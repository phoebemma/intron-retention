## Abstract

We profiled the skeletal muscle transcriptome of young and old individuals and observed a relative increase in IR in aged individuals. We further explored the impact of RT on IR . Genes with differential IR belonged to ontologies ...... and exhibited ..... differential expression levels

## Introduction

Intron retention events increase with aging @mariotti_deterioration_2022

Splicing accuracy is likely under-estimated @garcía-ruiz

There are three broad types of alternative splicing; exon skipping, alternative use of splice sites, and intron retention @nishida2015. IR is believed to control gene expression by either inserting a premature stop codon in a mature mRNA, or causing the expression of different mRNA isoform

IR is a type of alternative splicing where a full intron, or parts of an intron in a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) is retained during splicing. Other types of alternative exon skipping, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5' splice sites and alternative 3' splice sites @zheng2020 . Alternative splicing regulates life and death decisions @schwerk2005. mRNAs with retained introns play roles in normal physiology and in disease conditions @wong_intron_2016. It is a potential biomarker or driver of the aging process [@baralle2023 ; @adusumalli_increased_2019 ]. Tissues and organs are altered differently by aging and aging-related processes @baralle2023. IR can be said to be a regulator of gene expression in a variety of cellular processes as it could subject mRNA molecules that contain them to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) thereby eliminating the affected genes, or lead to frameshifts that make specific genes in response to particular signals [@baralle2023, @zheng2020, @mauger2016, @wong2022]. IRs in untranslated regions would influence gene expression differently from those in protein-coding regions. Each differential splicing event is expected to influence the function, location or expression level of a protein and thus would likely impact cell function

Splicing efficiency for individual introns is cell and tissue specific @nishida2015 differential splicing efficiency . As an individual ages, mis-splicing increases @garcía-ruiz

Short genes with high mRNA levels tend to be inefficiently spliced compared to long genes with low mRNA levels. IE, there is a positive correlaation between gene length ans SE @sánchez-escabias2022. Splicing efficiency of introns in the same gene have a lower variance than when compared to introns in different genes @sánchez-escabias2022. This suggests that a fair study of intron retention should be comparing same introns in same genes across the subjects of interest. Aging and aging-like phenotypes are associated with splicing alterations [@angarola2021, @garcía-ruiz, @nishida2015, @mariotti_deterioration_2022]

Exercise is said to be an anti-aging intervention targeted at maintaining not just muscle health, but general well-being

Eukaryotes are said to have two distinct pre-mRNA splicing machinery; the major spliceosome and the minor spliceosome . The major spliceosome is said to remove over 99% of introns while the minor spliceosome removes evolutionarily conserved introns @inoue2021

R used to be considered a result of mis-splicing which render transcripts non-functional @wong_intron_2016 but is increasingly being viewed as a mechanism of gene regulation. IR is deregulated in disease conditions @ge2014

Poor splicing efficiency is related to human diseases like alpha thalassemia @nelson2005 , inflammatory bowel disease @häsler2011 , and the risk of certain cancers [@dvinge2015; @inoue2021, @shah2022]

IR could serve as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases @sznajder2018, and various cancers [@dvinge2015, @inoue2021]

IR could occur in response to specific developmental cues and serve as a strategy for rapid mobilization of some mRNAs for protein translation @ong2020

missplicing occurs more in non-protein coding genes than in protein-coding genes @garcía-ruiz

@won

Alternative splicing is a mechanism through which messenger RNA transcripts encode different proteins . This leads to the huge proteomic diversity seen among all living beings. @angarola2021

IR increases with age and disease conditions, it also varies across tissues and organs [@ong2020; @mariotti_deterioration_2022; @garcía-ruiz]

advancing age goes with decrease in muscle strength @frontera_aging_2000

Age is said to be positively correlated with missplicing @garcía-ruiz

Aging is associated with the induction of different stress response pathways in different cell, tissue and specie types @stegeman2017 30 percent of alternative splicing changes in an organism occur during the aging process which is likely due to a decline in the expression of splicing factors @stegeman2017 Certain genes are said to be more prone to intron retention @stegeman2017 . Splicing damage increases with age and incidence of diseases [@mariotti_deterioration_2022 ; @stegeman2017]. The effects of retained introns could be varied depending on protein coding ability of the transcript

splicing effiociency of 0.99 might as well be several nucleotides unspliced

if aging is associated with decline in splicing efficiency, activities that improve splicing efficiency are potential targets of extending healthy lifespan and improving qualiry of life.

Aging is the progressive transformation of young organisms into aged ones. It involves changes across several physiological processes and is characterised by a progressive decline in most biological functions, and results to reduced vitality, increased risk of diseases and eventually death [@keshavarz2023; @gyenis_genome-wide_2023] . It is the greatest cause of disease and death worldwide @schaum_ageing_2020 . Aging and its processes can be targeted with therapeutics and measures aimed at slowing it down.

The concept of the "biological clock" is organ, system and sex specific @nie2022

The hallmarks of aging are said to include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of prosteostatsis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication @lópez-otín2013

Monitoring IR in *vastula lateralis* in young and old and how they are impacted by RT could offer valuable insights into not just how age affects IR, but how RT could impact it too

### Research questions

We hypothesize that intron retention is a mechanism by which the cells modify gene expression in response to muscular stress

Is intron retention different in old versus young?

What impact does RT have on that phenomenon

what genes are particularly more retained and more spliced out in young versus adults

## Materials and methods

Five datasets were included in the study. Selection criteria for the dataset were that the data had to paired-end Illumina RNA-Seq data from vastus lateralis muscle of human subjects below 40 years old for the young subjects, and above 50 for the old subjects
