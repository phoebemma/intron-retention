	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To investigate the effect of 15 weeks of resistance training on the frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women. {STUDY}  {DESIGN}: Postmenopausal women with at least 4 moderate or severe hot flushes or  night sweats per day day were randomized to a 15-week resistance training  intervention or unchanged physical activity. Participants did not exercise  regularly at baseline and had not used any therapy for hot flushes two months  prior to study entry. The resistance training was performed three times per week  and the program contained 8 exercises performed with 8-12 repetitions in 2 sets.  Loads were set individually from eight-repetition maximum-strength tests and  increased progressively. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was change in  mean moderate or severe hot flushes per day from baseline to week 15, assessed  with symptom diaries. Secondary outcomes included change in hot flush score and  time spent on physical activity. {RESULTS}: Between November 19, 2013, and October  26, 2016, 65 women were enrolled; 58 completed the trial and were included in the  analyses. The mean age was 55 and the mean number of moderate or severe hot  flushes per day at baseline was 7.1; there were no baseline differences between  groups. The frequency of hot flushes decreased more in the intervention group  than in the control group (mean difference -2.7, 95\% {CI} -4.2 to -1.3). The mean  percentage change was -43.6\% (-56.0 to -31.3) in the intervention group and -2.0\%  (-16.4-12.4) in the control group. {CONCLUSION}: A 15-week resistance-training  program decreased the frequency of moderate and severe hot flushes among  postmenopausal women and could be an effective and safe treatment option to  alleviate vasomotor symptoms.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fibromyalgia ({FM}) is characterized by chronic and generalized musculoskeletal pain. There is currently no cure for {FM}, but alternative  treatments are available. Among them, gradual strength training programs ({ST})  which on daily activities are a valid option to improve some of the pronounced  symptoms of {FM} that affect quality of life, such as fatigue, pain, sleep quality,  and physical function. However, there is a need for more information on optimal  training programs to improve anxiety and fatigue symptoms. {AIM}: To analyze the  effects of a 24-week gradual and progressive {ST} on sleep quality, fatigue, pain  domains, physical function, and anxiety-state. {METHODS}: 41 women with {FM}  participated in the 24 weeks of intervention based on gradual and progressive {ST}.  Two, 60 min, training sessions per week were con-ducted. Participants were  evaluated before the {ST} program (week 0), in week 12 and at the end of the {ST}  program (week 24). The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire was used to  assess sleep quality and fatigue scales. Anxiety-state was evaluated with the  State Anxiety Inventory, and pain domains by means of the Brief Pain Inventory.  Senior Fitness Test was used for physical function measurements. One-way analysis  of variance ({ANOVA}) was applied to assess the mean differences between phases,  and Spearman's correlations were used to assess the associations between physical  and psychological symptoms, and physical function. {RESULTS}: The results  demonstrated that 24 weeks of {ST} improves physical function, sleep quality and  pain domains (p ≤ 0.05). Higher anxiety and pain interference scores were related  to worsening physical function. {CONCLUSIONS}: Gradual {ST} significantly improves  sleep quality, pain, and physical function, but not anxiety and fatigue.},

	abstract = {Fibromyalgia ({FM}) is a complex disorder and a clinical challenge to diagnose and treat. Microdialysis is a valuable tool that has been used to investigate the  interstitial proteins and metabolites of muscle in patients with fibromyalgia.  The implantation of the catheter in the muscle causes acute tissue trauma and  nociception. The aim of this study was to investigate acute proteome changes in  the vastus lateralis muscle in women fibromyalgia patients ({FM}) and healthy  subjects ({CON}). A further aim was to study if a 15-week resistance exercise  program in {FM} had any influence on how chronic painful muscle responds to acute  nociception. Twenty-six women patients with {FM} and twenty-eight {CON} were included  in this study. A microdialysis catheter (100 kilo Dalton cut off, membrane 30 mm)  was inserted in the vastus lateralis muscle, and samples were collected every 20  min. Subjects rated pain before catheter insertion, directly after, and every 20  min of sample collection. Dialysate samples from time points 0-120 were pooled  and considered trauma samples due to the catheter insertion. The samples were  analyzed with nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({nLC}-{MS}/{MS}).  Advanced multivariate data analysis was used to investigate protein profile  changes between the groups. Multivariate data analysis showed significant  ({CV}-{ANOVA} p = 0.036) discrimination between {FM} and {CON} based on changes in 26  proteins. After the 15-week exercise intervention, the expression levels of the  15 proteins involved in muscle contraction, response to stimulus, stress, and  immune system were increased to the same expression levels as in {CON}. In  conclusion, this study shows that microdialysis, in combination with proteomics,  can provide new insights into the interstitial proteome in the muscle of {FM}. In  response to acute nociception, exercise may alter the innate reactivity in {FM}.  Exercise may also modulate peripheral muscle proteins related to muscle  contraction, stress, and immune response in patients with {FM}.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Fibromyalgia ({FM}) is characterized by persistent widespread pain, increased pain sensitivity and tenderness. Muscle strength in women with {FM} is  reduced compared to healthy women. The aim of this study was to examine the  effects of a progressive resistance exercise program on muscle strength, health  status, and current pain intensity in women with {FM}. {METHODS}: A total of 130  women with {FM} (age 22-64 years, symptom duration 0-35 years) were included in  this assessor-blinded randomized controlled multi-center trial examining the  effects of progressive resistance group exercise compared with an active control  group. A person-centred model of exercise was used to support the participants'  self-confidence for management of exercise because of known risks of  activity-induced pain in {FM}. The intervention was performed twice a week for 15  weeks and was supervised by experienced physiotherapists. Primary outcome measure  was isometric knee-extension force (Steve Strong®), secondary outcome measures  were health status ({FIQ} total score), current pain intensity ({VAS}), 6MWT,  isometric elbow-flexion force, hand-grip force, health related quality of life,  pain disability, pain acceptance, fear avoidance beliefs, and patient global  impression of change ({PGIC}). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediately  after the intervention. Long-term follow up comprised the self-reported  questionnaires only and was conducted after 13-18 months. Between-group and  within-group differences were calculated using non-parametric statistics.  {RESULTS}: Significant improvements were found for isometric knee-extension force  (p = 0.010), health status (p = 0.038), current pain intensity (p = 0.033), 6MWT  (p = 0.003), isometric elbow flexion force (p = 0.02), pain disability (p =  0.005), and pain acceptance (p = 0.043) in the resistance exercise group (n = 56)  when compared to the control group (n = 49). {PGIC} differed significantly (p =  0.001) in favor of the resistance exercise group at post-treatment examinations.  No significant differences between the resistance exercise group and the active  control group were found regarding change in self-reported questionnaires from  baseline to 13-18 months. {CONCLUSIONS}: Person-centered progressive resistance  exercise was found to be a feasible mode of exercise for women with {FM}, improving  muscle strength, health status, and current pain intensity when assessed  immediately after the intervention. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {ClinicalTrials}.gov  identification number: {NCT}01226784, Oct 21, 2010.},

The aerobic exercise group received an aerobic  exercise intervention, while the resistance exercise group received a resistance  exercise intervention. Both groups received exercise intervention for 50-60 min,  3 times per week, lasting for 6 weeks. In addition, patients in both groups  received the same routine care, including personalized dietary intervention,  online education, and school courses for pregnant women. {RESULTS}: The blood  glucose level in the resistance exercise group and the aerobic exercise group was  lower after the intervention than before the intervention (p{\textless}0.05). After the  intervention, no significant differences were observed in the fasting blood  glucose level, insulin utilization rate, and incidence of adverse pregnancy  outcomes between the two groups (p{\textgreater}0.05); however, significant differences were  noted in 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level and exercise compliance between  the two groups (p{\textless}0.05), with the resistance exercise group showing better  outcomes than the aerobic exercise group. {CONCLUSIONS}: Resistance exercise is  more compliant for pregnant women with {GDM} than aerobic exercise; hence, it is  necessary to popularize resistance exercise in this specific population group.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obesity causes frailty in older adults; however, weight loss might accelerate age-related loss of muscle and bone mass and resultant sarcopenia and  osteopenia. {METHODS}: In this clinical trial involving 160 obese older adults, we  evaluated the effectiveness of several exercise modes in reversing frailty and  preventing reduction in muscle and bone mass induced by weight loss. Participants  were randomly assigned to a weight-management program plus one of three exercise  programs - aerobic training, resistance training, or combined aerobic and  resistance training - or to a control group (no weight-management or exercise  program). The primary outcome was the change in Physical Performance Test score  from baseline to 6 months (scores range from 0 to 36 points; higher scores  indicate better performance). Secondary outcomes included changes in other  frailty measures, body composition, bone mineral density, and physical functions.  {RESULTS}: A total of 141 participants completed the study. The Physical  Performance Test score increased more in the combination group than in the  aerobic and resistance groups (27.9 to 33.4 points [21\% increase] vs. 29.3 to  33.2 points [14\% increase] and 28.8 to 32.7 points [14\% increase], respectively;  P=0.01 and P=0.02 after Bonferroni correction); the scores increased more in all  exercise groups than in the control group (P{\textless}0.001 for between-group  comparisons). Peak oxygen consumption (milliliters per kilogram of body weight  per minute) increased more in the combination and aerobic groups (17.2 to 20.3  [17\% increase] and 17.6 to 20.9 [18\% increase], respectively) than in the  resistance group (17.0 to 18.3 [8\% increase]) (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons).  Strength increased more in the combination and resistance groups (272 to 320 kg  [18\% increase] and 288 to 337 kg [19\% increase], respectively) than in the  aerobic group (265 to 270 kg [4\% increase]) (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Body  weight decreased by 9\% in all exercise groups but did not change significantly in  the control group. Lean mass decreased less in the combination and resistance  groups than in the aerobic group (56.5 to 54.8 kg [3\% decrease] and 58.1 to 57.1  kg [2\% decrease], respectively, vs. 55.0 to 52.3 kg [5\% decrease]), as did bone  mineral density at the total hip (grams per square centimeter; 1.010 to 0.996 [1\%  decrease] and 1.047 to 1.041 [0.5\% decrease], respectively, vs. 1.018 to 0.991  [3\% decrease]) (P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons).

The purposes of the  current trial were to: (1) quantify the effects of aerobic exercise and  resistance training on anxiety-related disorder (including anxiety disorders,  obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) status,  symptoms, and constructs, (2) evaluate whether both modalities of exercise were  equivalent, and (3) to determine whether exercise enjoyment and physical fitness  are associated with symptom reduction. A total of 48 individuals with  anxiety-related disorders were randomized to aerobic exercise, resistance  training, or a waitlist. Symptoms of anxiety-related disorders, related  constructs, and exercise enjoyment were assessed at pre-intervention and weekly  during the 4-week intervention. Participants were further assessed 1-week and  1-month post-intervention. Both exercise modalities were efficacious in improving  disorder status. As well, aerobic exercise improved general psychological  distress and anxiety, while resistance training improved disorder-specific  symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and intolerance of  uncertainty. Physical fitness predicted reductions in general psychological  distress for both types of exercise and reductions in stress for aerobic  exercise. Results highlight the efficacy of different exercise modalities in  uniquely addressing anxiety-related disorder symptoms and constructs.},

Twelve healthy sedentary men were studied in 1985-86 (T1)  and nine (initial mean age 65.4 +/- 4.2 yr) were reevaluated in 1997-98 (T2).  Isokinetic muscle strength of the knee and elbow extensors and flexors showed  losses (P {\textless} 0.05) ranging from 20 to 30\% at slow and fast angular velocities.  Computerized tomography (n = 7) showed reductions (P {\textless} 0.05) in the  cross-sectional area ({CSA}) of the thigh (12.5\%), all thigh muscles (14.7\%),  quadriceps femoris muscle (16.1\%), and flexor muscles (14. 9\%). Analysis of  covariance showed that strength at T1 and changes in {CSA} were independent  predictors of strength at T2. Muscle biopsies taken from vastus lateralis muscles  (n = 6) showed a reduction in percentage of type I fibers (T1 = 60\% vs. T2 = 42\%)  with no change in mean area in either fiber type. The capillary-to-fiber ratio  was significantly lower at T2 (1.39 vs. 1. 08; P = 0.043). Our observations  suggest that a quantitative loss in muscle {CSA} is a major contributor to the  decrease in muscle strength seen with advancing age and, together with muscle  strength at T1, accounts for 90\% of the variability in strength at T2.},

	abstract = {Frailty, a consequence of the interaction of the aging process and certain chronic diseases, compromises functional outcomes in the elderly and  substantially increases their risk for developing disabilities and other adverse  outcomes. Frailty follows from the combination of several impaired physiological  mechanisms affecting multiple organs and systems. And, though frailty and  sarcopenia are related, they are two different conditions. Thus, strategies to  preserve or improve functional status should consider systemic function in  addition to muscle conditioning. Physical activity/exercise is considered one of  the main strategies to counteract frailty-related physical impairment in the  elderly. Exercise reduces age-related oxidative damage and chronic inflammation,  increases autophagy, and improves mitochondrial function, myokine profile,  insulin-like growth factor-1 ({IGF}-1) signaling pathway, and insulin sensitivity.  Exercise interventions target resistance (strength and power), aerobic, balance,  and flexibility work. Each type improves different aspects of physical  functioning, though they could be combined according to need and prescribed as a  multicomponent intervention. Therefore, exercise intervention programs should be  prescribed based on an individual's physical functioning and adapted to the  ensuing response.},

Aim1 was to determine the agreement between midthigh vastus lateralis ({VL}) cross-sectional area measured by ultrasound ({mCSA}({US}))  versus magnetic resonance imaging ({mCSA}({MRI})) at a single time point, and the  ability of each to detect hypertrophic changes. Aim2 was to assess the  relationships between pre- and posttraining changes in thigh lean mass determined  by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA}), {VL} {mCSA}({US}), ultrasound-determined {VL}  thickness ({VL}(Thick)), and {VL} mean myofiber cross-sectional area ({fCSA}) with  changes in {VL} {mCSA}({MRI}). Twelve untrained males (age: 20 ± 1 yr, {BMI}: 26.9 ± 5.4  kg/m(2); n = 12) engaged in a 10-wk resistance training program (2×/week) where  right midthigh images and {VL} biopsies were obtained before and 72 h following the  last training bout. Participants' {VL} {mCSA}({MRI}) (P = 0.005), {DXA} thigh lean mass  (P = 0.015), and {VL}(Thick) (P = 0.001) increased following training, whereas {VL}  {mCSA}({US}) and {fCSA} did not. For Aim1, {mCSA}({US}) demonstrated excellent concordance  [concordance correlation coefficients ({CCC}) = 0.830] with {mCSA}({MRI}), albeit  {mCSA}({US}) values were systematically lower compared with {mCSA}({MRI}) (mean bias:  -2.29 cm(2)). In addition, {PRE}-to-{POST} {VL} {mCSA} changes between techniques  exhibited good agreement ({CCC} = 0.700; mean bias: -1.08 cm(2)). For Aim2,  moderate, positive correlations existed for pre-to-post changes in {VL} {mCSA}({MRI})  and {DXA} thigh lean mass (r = 0.580, P = 0.048), {mCSA}({US}) (r = 0.622, P = 0.031),  and {VL}(Thick) (r = 0.520, P = 0.080). A moderate, negative correlation existed  between {mCSA}({MRI}) and {fCSA} (r = -0.569, P = 0.054). Our findings have multiple  implications: 1) resistance training-induced hypertrophy was dependent on the  quantification method, 2) ultrasound-determined {mCSA} shows good agreement with  {MRI}, and 3) tissue-level changes poorly agreed with mean {fCSA} changes and this  requires further research.{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} This is the first study to  comprehensively examine how different midthigh muscle imaging techniques and  histology compare with one another in participants that performed 10 weeks of  resistance training. Our study suggests that histology results show poor  agreement with results yielded from other common muscle imaging techniques, and  researchers should be aware of this limitation.},

	abstract = {We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in  full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual  x-ray absorptiometry ({DXA}), vastus lateralis ({VL}) thickness via ultrasound,  blood, {VL} muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-{RM}) squat strength  were obtained prior to ({PRE}) and following ({POST}) 12 weeks of training. K-means  cluster analysis based on {VL} thickness changes identified {LOW} [n = 17; change  (mean±{SD}) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest ({MOD}; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high ({HI}; n  = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome  biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed  between clusters. There were main effects of time ({POST}{\textgreater}{PRE}, p{\textless}0.05) but no  cluster×time interactions for increases in {DXA} lean body mass, type I and {II}  muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number,  and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, {PRE} {VL} thickness was {\textasciitilde}12\% greater in  {LOW} versus {HI} (p = 0.021), despite {POST} values being {\textasciitilde}12\% greater in {HI} versus  {LOW} (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between {PRE} {VL}  thickness scores and change in {VL} thickness (r2 = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post  hoc analysis indicated that muscle total {RNA} levels (i.e., ribosome density) did  not significantly increase in the {LOW} cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p =  0.253), but increased in the {MOD} (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and {HI} clusters  (356±77 to 470±134, p{\textless}0.001; {POST} {HI}{\textgreater}{POST} {LOW}, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was  only a weak association between change in muscle total {RNA} and {VL} thickness (r2 =  0.079, p = 0.026). {IL}-1β {mRNA} levels decreased in the {MOD} and {HI} clusters  following training (p{\textless}0.05), although associations between this marker and {VL}  thickness changes were not significant (r2 = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion,  individuals with lower pre-training {VL} thickness values and greater increases  muscle total {RNA} levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced  greater {VL} muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only  {\textasciitilde}8-11\% of the variance in hypertrophy.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD010884},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain that leads to reduced physical function. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a  treatment for management of symptoms. We examined the literature on resistance  training for individuals with fibromyalgia. Resistance training is exercise  performed against a progressive resistance with the intention of improving muscle  strength, muscle endurance, muscle power, or a combination of these. {OBJECTIVES}:  To evaluate the benefits and harms of resistance exercise training in adults with  fibromyalgia. We compared resistance training versus control and versus other  types of exercise training. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched nine electronic databases  (The Cochrane Library, {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {CINAHL}, {PEDro}, Dissertation Abstracts,  Current Controlled Trials, World Health Organization ({WHO}) International Clinical  Trials Registry Platform, {AMED}) and other sources for published full-text  articles. The date of the last search was 5 March 2013. Two review authors  independently screened 1856 citations, 766 abstracts and 156 full-text articles.  We included five studies that met our inclusion criteria. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}:  Selection criteria included: a) randomized clinical trial, b) diagnosis of  fibromyalgia based on published criteria, c) adult sample, d) full-text  publication, and e) inclusion of between-group data comparing resistance training  versus a control or other physical activity intervention. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND}  {ANALYSIS}: Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and  extracted intervention and outcome data. We resolved disagreements between the  two review authors and questions regarding interpretation of study methods by  discussion within the pairs or when necessary the issue was taken to the full  team of 11 members. We extracted 21 outcomes of which seven were designated as  major outcomes: multidimensional function, self reported physical function, pain,  tenderness, muscle strength, attrition rates, and adverse effects. We evaluated  benefits and harms of the interventions using standardized mean differences ({SMD})  or mean differences ({MD}) or risk ratios or Peto odds ratios and 95\% confidence  intervals ({CI}). Where two or more studies provided data for an outcome, we  carried out a meta-analysis. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The literature search yielded 1865  citations with five studies meeting the selection criteria. One of the studies  that had three arms contributed data for two comparisons. In the included  studies, there were 219 women participants with fibromyalgia, 95 of whom were  assigned to resistance training programs. Three randomized trials compared 16 to  21 weeks of moderate- to high-intensity resistance training versus a control  group. Two studies compared eight weeks of progressive resistance training  (intensity as tolerated) using free weights or body weight resistance exercise  versus aerobic training (ie, progressive treadmill walking, indoor and outdoor  walking), and one study compared 12 weeks of low-intensity resistance training  using hand weights (1 to 3 lbs (0.45 to 1.36 kg)) and elastic tubing versus  flexibility exercise (static stretches to major muscle groups).Statistically  significant differences ({MD}; 95\% {CI}) favoring the resistance training  interventions over control group(s) were found in multidimensional function  (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ({FIQ}) total decreased 16.75 units on a  100-point scale; 95\% {CI} -23.31 to -10.19), self reported physical function (-6.29  units on a 100-point scale; 95\% {CI} -10.45 to -2.13), pain (-3.3 cm on a 10-cm  scale; 95\% {CI} -6.35 to -0.26), tenderness (-1.84 out of 18 tender points; 95\% {CI}  -2.6 to -1.08), and muscle strength (27.32 kg force on bilateral concentric leg  extension; 95\% {CI} 18.28 to 36.36).Differences between the resistance training  group(s) and the aerobic training groups were not statistically significant for  multidimensional function (5.48 on a 100-point scale; 95\% {CI} -0.92 to 11.88),  self reported physical function (-1.48 units on a 100-point scale; 95\% {CI} -6.69  to 3.74) or tenderness ({SMD} -0.13; 95\% {CI} -0.55 to 0.30). There was a  statistically significant reduction in pain (0.99 cm on a 10-cm scale; 95\% {CI}  0.31 to 1.67) favoring the aerobic groups.Statistically significant differences  were found between a resistance training group and a flexibility group favoring  the resistance training group for multidimensional function (-6.49 {FIQ} units on a  100-point scale; 95\% {CI} -12.57 to -0.41) and pain (-0.88 cm on a 10-cm scale; 95\%  {CI} -1.57 to -0.19), but not for tenderness (-0.46 out of 18 tender points; 95\% {CI}  -1.56 to 0.64) or strength (4.77 foot pounds torque on concentric knee extension;  95\% {CI} -2.40 to 11.94). This evidence was classified low quality due to the low  number of studies and risk of bias assessment. There were no statistically  significant differences in attrition rates between the interventions. In general,  adverse effects were poorly recorded, but no serious adverse effects were  reported. Assessment of risk of bias was hampered by poor written descriptions  (eg, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors). The lack of a priori  protocols and lack of care provider blinding were also identified as methodologic  concerns. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: The evidence (rated as low quality) suggested  that moderate- and moderate- to high-intensity resistance training improves  multidimensional function, pain, tenderness, and muscle strength in women with  fibromyalgia. The evidence (rated as low quality) also suggested that eight weeks  of aerobic exercise was superior to moderate-intensity resistance training for  improving pain in women with fibromyalgia. There was low-quality evidence that 12  weeks of low-intensity resistance training was superior to flexibility exercise  training in women with fibromyalgia for improvements in pain and multidimensional  function. There was low-quality evidence that women with fibromyalgia can safely  perform moderate- to high-resistance training.},

	abstract = {Increasing muscle mass is important when attempting to maximize sports performance and achieve physique augmentation. However, the preservation of  muscle mass is essential to maintaining mobility and quality of life with aging,  and also impacts on our capacity to recover from illness. Nevertheless, our  understanding of the processes that regulate muscle mass in humans during  resistance exercise training, chronic disuse and rehabilitation training  following atrophy remains very unclear. Here, we report on some of the recent  developments in the study of those processes thought to be responsible for  governing human muscle protein turnover in response to intense physical activity.  Specifically, the effects of acute and chronic resistance exercise in healthy  volunteers and also in response to rehabilitation resistance exercise training  following muscle atrophy will be discussed, with discrepancies and gaps in our  understanding highlighted. In particular, ubiquitin-proteasome mediated muscle  proteolysis (Muscle Atrophy F-box/Atrogin-1 and Muscle {RING} Finger 1),  translation initiation of muscle protein synthesis (mammalian target of rapamycin  signaling), and satellite cell mediated myogenesis are highlighted as pathways of  special relevance to muscle protein metabolism in response to acute resistance  exercise. Furthermore, research focused on quantifying signaling and molecular  events that modulate muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation under  conditions of chronic resistance training is highlighted as being urgently needed  to improve knowledge gaps. These studies need to include multiple time-point  measurements over the course of any training intervention and must include  dynamic measurements of muscle protein synthesis and degradation and sensitive  measures of muscle mass.

In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading  complicates the identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. A  within-person differential loading and analysis strategy reduces heterogeneity  for changes in muscle mass by ∼40\% and uses a genome-wide transcriptome method  that models each {mRNA} from coding exons and 3' and 5' untranslated regions  ({UTRs}). Our strategy detects ∼3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized  studies, including substantial {UTR}-selective regulation undetected by other  methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we  validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n = 100). Further validating  these identified genes via {RNAi} in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that  members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis. Using  proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis reveals notable relationships  with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity,  as well as potential drug therapies.},

These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document.The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity?For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, {EWGSOP} recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). {EWGSOP} variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as ‘presarcopenia’, ‘sarcopenia’ and ‘severe sarcopenia’. {EWGSOP} reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research.Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment.},

	abstract = {We sought to determine the skeletal muscle genome-wide {DNA} methylation and {mRNA} responses to one bout of lower load ({LL}) versus higher load ({HL}) resistance  exercise. Trained college-aged males (n = 11, 23 ± 4 years old, 4 ± 3 years  self-reported training) performed {LL} or {HL} bouts to failure separated by one  week. The {HL} bout (i.e., 80 Fail) consisted of four sets of back squats and four  sets of leg extensions to failure using 80\% of participants estimated  one-repetition maximum (i.e., est. 1-{RM}). The {LL} bout (i.e., 30 Fail) implemented  the same paradigm with 30\% of est. 1-{RM}. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were  collected before, 3 h, and 6 h after each bout. Muscle {DNA} and {RNA} were  batch-isolated and analyzed using the 850k Illumina {MethylationEPIC} array and  Clariom S {mRNA} microarray, respectively. Performed repetitions were significantly  greater during the 30 Fail versus 80 Fail (p {\textless} 0.001), although total training  volume (sets × reps × load) was not significantly different between bouts (p =  0.571). Regardless of bout, more {CpG} site methylation changes were observed at 3  h versus 6 h post exercise (239,951 versus 12,419, respectively; p {\textless} 0.01), and  nuclear global ten-eleven translocation ({TET}) activity, but not global {DNA}  methyltransferase activity, increased 3 h and 6 h following exercise regardless  of bout. The percentage of genes significantly altered at the {mRNA} level that  demonstrated opposite {DNA} methylation patterns was greater 3 h versus 6 h  following exercise ({\textasciitilde}75\% versus {\textasciitilde}15\%, respectively). Moreover, high percentages  of genes that were up- or downregulated 6 h following exercise also demonstrated  significantly inversed {DNA} methylation patterns across one or more {CpG} sites 3 h  following exercise (65\% and 82\%, respectively). While 30 Fail decreased {DNA}  methylation across various promoter regions versus 80 Fail, transcriptome-wide  {mRNA} and bioinformatics indicated that gene expression signatures were largely  similar between bouts. Bioinformatics overlay of {DNA} methylation and {mRNA}  expression data indicated that genes related to "Focal adhesion," "{MAPK}  signaling," and "{PI}3K-Akt signaling" were significantly affected at the 3 h and 6  h time points, and again this was regardless of bout. In conclusion, extensive  molecular profiling suggests that post-exercise alterations in the skeletal  muscle {DNA} methylome and {mRNA} transcriptome elicited by {LL} and {HL} training bouts  to failure are largely similar, and this could be related to equal volumes  performed between bouts.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many  individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is  particularly common among older adults and those with chronic diseases (e.g.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {COPD}) and may involve endocrine variables  such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on  responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored. {METHODS}: Ninety-five  male and female participants (healthy, n = 71; {COPD}, n = 24; age 68 ± 5 years)  were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D(3) or placebo supplementation  for 28 weeks in a double-blinded manner (latitude 61°N, September-May).  Seventy-eight participants completed the {RCT}, which was initiated by 12 weeks of  supplementation-only (two weeks with 10 000 {IU}/day, followed by 2000 {IU}/day),  followed by 13 weeks of combined supplementation (2000 {IU}/day) and supervised  whole-body resistance training (twice weekly), interspersed with testing and  measurements. Outcome measures included multiple assessments of muscle strength  (n(variables)  = 7), endurance performance (n = 6), and muscle mass (n = 3, legs,  primary), as well as muscle quality (legs), muscle biology (m. vastus lateralis;  muscle fibre characteristics, transcriptome), and health-related variables (e.g.  visceral fat mass and blood lipid profile). For main outcome domains such as  muscle strength and muscle mass, weighted combined factors were calculated from  the range of singular assessments. {RESULTS}: Overall, 13 weeks of resistance  training increased muscle strength (13\% ± 8\%), muscle mass (9\% ± 8\%), and  endurance performance (one-legged, 23\% ± 15\%; whole-body, 8\% ± 7\%), assessed as  weighted combined factors, and were associated with changes in health variables  (e.g. visceral fat, -6\% ± 21\%; [{LDL}](serum) , -4\% ± 14\%) and muscle tissue  characteristics such as fibre type proportions (e.g. {IIX}, -3\% points), myonuclei  per fibre (30\% ± 65\%), total {RNA}/{rRNA} abundances (15\%/6-19\%), and transcriptome  profiles (e.g. 312 differentially expressed genes). Vitamin D(3) supplementation  did not affect training-associated changes for any of the main outcome domains,  despite robust increases in [25({OH})D](serum) (∆49\% vs. placebo). No conditional  effects were observed for {COPD} vs. healthy or pre-{RCT} [25({OH})D](serum) . In  secondary analyses, vitamin D(3) affected expression of gene sets involved in  vascular functions in muscle tissue and strength gains in participants with high  fat mass, which advocates further study. {CONCLUSIONS}: Vitamin D(3)  supplementation did not affect muscular responses to resistance training in older  adults with or without {COPD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) are prone to accelerated decay of muscle strength and mass with advancing age. This is  believed to be driven by disease-inherent systemic pathophysiologies, which are  also assumed to drive muscle cells into a state of anabolic resistance, leading  to impaired abilities to adapt to resistance exercise training. Currently, this  phenomenon remains largely unstudied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the  assumed negative effects of {COPD} for health- and muscle-related responsiveness to  resistance training using a healthy control-based translational approach.  {METHODS}: Subjects with {COPD} (n = 20, {GOLD} {II}-{III}, {FEV}(1predicted) 57 ± 11\%, age  69 ± 5) and healthy controls (Healthy, n = 58, {FEV}(1predicted) 112 ± 16\%, age  67 ± 4) conducted identical whole-body resistance training interventions for  13 weeks, consisting of two weekly supervised training sessions. Leg exercises  were performed unilaterally, with one leg conducting high-load training (10RM)  and the contralateral leg conducting low-load training (30RM). Measurements  included muscle strength (n(variables) = 7), endurance performance  (n(variables) = 6), muscle mass (n(variables) = 3), muscle quality, muscle  biology (m. vastus lateralis; muscle fiber characteristics, {RNA} content including  transcriptome) and health variables (body composition, blood). For core outcome  domains, weighted combined factors were calculated from the range of singular  assessments. {RESULTS}: {COPD} displayed well-known pathophysiologies at baseline,  including elevated levels of systemic low-grade inflammation ([c-reactive  protein](serum)), reduced muscle mass and functionality, and muscle biological  aberrancies. Despite this, resistance training led to improved lower-limb muscle  strength (15 ± 8\%), muscle mass (7 ± 5\%), muscle quality (8 ± 8\%) and  lower-limb/whole-body endurance performance (26 ± 12\%/8 ± 9\%) in {COPD}, resembling  or exceeding responses in Healthy, measured in both relative and numeric change  terms. Within the {COPD} cluster, lower {FEV}(1predicted) was associated with larger  numeric and relative increases in muscle mass and superior relative improvements  in maximal muscle strength. This was accompanied by similar changes in hallmarks  of muscle biology such as {rRNA}-content↑, muscle fiber cross-sectional area↑, type  {IIX} proportions↓, and changes in {mRNA} transcriptomics. Neither of the core  outcome domains were differentially affected by resistance training load.  {CONCLUSIONS}: {COPD} showed hitherto largely unrecognized responsiveness to  resistance training, rejecting the notion of disease-related impairments and  rather advocating such training as a potent measure to relieve pathophysiologies.  {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {ClinicalTrials}.gov {ID}: {NCT}02598830.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including major non-communicable diseases such as  coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and  shortens life expectancy. Because much of the world's population is inactive,  this link presents a major public health issue. We aimed to quantify the eff ect  of physical inactivity on these major non-communicable diseases by estimating how  much disease could be averted if inactive people were to become active and to  estimate gain in life expectancy at the population level. {METHODS}: For our  analysis of burden of disease, we calculated population attributable fractions  ({PAFs}) associated with physical inactivity using conservative assumptions for  each of the major non-communicable diseases, by country, to estimate how much  disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated. We used  life-table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.  {FINDINGS}: Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6\% (ranging from  3·2\% in southeast Asia to 7·8\% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden  of disease from coronary heart disease, 7\% (3·9-9·6) of type 2 diabetes, 10\%  (5·6-14·1) of breast cancer, and 10\% (5·7-13·8) of colon cancer. Inactivity  causes 9\% (range 5·1-12·5) of premature mortality, or more than 5·3 million of  the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not  eliminated, but decreased instead by 10\% or 25\%, more than 533 000 and more than  1·3 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that  elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the  world's population by 0·68 (range 0·41-0·95) years. {INTERPRETATION}: Physical  inactivity has a major health eff ect worldwide. Decrease in or removal of this  unhealthy behaviour could improve health substantially. {FUNDING}: None.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Skeletal muscle atrophy manifests across numerous diseases; however, the extent of similarities/differences in causal mechanisms between atrophying  conditions in unclear. Ageing and disuse represent two of the most prevalent and  costly atrophic conditions, with resistance exercise training ({RET}) being the  most effective lifestyle countermeasure. We employed gene-level and network-level  meta-analyses to contrast transcriptomic signatures of disuse and {RET}, plus young  and older {RET} to establish a consensus on the molecular features of, and  therapeutic targets against, muscle atrophy in conditions of high socio-economic  relevance. {METHODS}: Integrated gene-level and network-level meta-analysis was  performed on publicly available microarray data sets generated from young  (18-35 years) m. vastus lateralis muscle subjected to disuse (unilateral limb  immobilization or bed rest) lasting ≥7 days or {RET} lasting ≥3 weeks, and  resistance-trained older (≥60 years) muscle. {RESULTS}: Disuse and {RET} displayed  predominantly separate transcriptional responses, and transcripts altered across  conditions were mostly unidirectional. However, disuse and {RET} induced directly  inverted expression profiles for mitochondrial function and translation  regulation genes, with {COX}4I1, {ENDOG}, {GOT}2, {MRPL}12, and {NDUFV}2, the central hub  components of altered mitochondrial networks, and {ZMYND}11, a hub gene of altered  translation regulation. A substantial number of genes (n = 140) up-regulated  post-{RET} in younger muscle were not similarly up-regulated in older muscle, with  young muscle displaying a more pronounced extracellular matrix ({ECM}) and  immune/inflammatory gene expression response. Both young and older muscle  exhibited similar {RET}-induced ubiquitination/{RNA} processing gene signatures with  associated {PWP}1, {PSMB}1, and {RAF}1 hub genes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Despite limited opposing  gene profiles, transcriptional signatures of disuse are not simply the converse  of {RET}. Thus, the mechanisms of unloading cannot be derived from studying muscle  loading alone and provides a molecular basis for understanding why {RET} fails to  target all transcriptional features of disuse. Loss of {RET}-induced {ECM}  mechanotransduction and inflammatory profiles might also contribute to suboptimal  ageing muscle adaptations to {RET}. Disuse and age-dependent molecular candidates  further establish a framework for understanding and treating disuse/ageing  atrophy.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function and metabolic health. Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise ({RE};  loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, {RE} mitigates muscle loss.  Resistance exercise training ({RET})-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a  product of external (e.g., {RE} programming, diet, some supplements) and internal  variables (e.g., mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells  activity). {RE} is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable  to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular  hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite  considerable research on the impact of external variables on {RET} and hypertrophy,  internal variables (i.e., inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in  regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus,  identifying the key internal skeletal muscle-derived variables that mediate the  translation of external {RE} variables will be pivotal to determining the most  effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such  work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional  decline, and promoting physical mobility.

	abstract = {Purpose 

This study aimed to assess the effects of 20 wk resistance exercise training with or without protein supplementation on body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance, and aerobic capacity in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy ({ADT}).

Methods

Sixty prostate cancer patients receiving {ADT} were randomly assigned to perform 20 wk of resistance exercise training with supplementation of 31 g whey protein ({EX} + {PRO}, n = 30) or placebo ({EX} + {PLA}, n = 30), consumed immediately after exercise and every night before sleep. A separate control group ({CON}, n = 36) only received usual care. At baseline and after 20 wk, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle mass (computed tomography scan), muscle strength (1-repetition maximum strength tests), physical performance (Timed Up and Go Test, 30-Second Chair Stand Test, and Stair Climb Test), aerobic capacity (cardiopulmonary exercise test), and habitual dietary intake (food diary) were assessed. Data were analyzed using a two-factor repeated-measures {ANOVA}.

Results

Over time, muscle mass and strength increased in {EX} + {PRO} and {EX} + {PLA} and decreased in {CON}. Total fat mass and fat percentage increased in {EX} + {PRO} and {CON}, but not in {EX} + {PLA}. Physical performance did not significantly change over time in either group. Aerobic capacity was maintained in {EX} + {PLA}, but it decreased in {EX} + {PRO} and {CON}. Habitual protein intake (without supplements) averaged {\textgreater}1.0 g·kg body weight−1·d−1, with no differences over time or between groups.

Conclusions

In prostate cancer patients, resistance exercise training counteracts the adverse effects of {ADT} on body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity, with no additional benefits of protein supplementation.},

A literature search was performed in four databases. Studies were  included if they explored the effects of {EO} on dynamic muscular strength and/or  muscle hypertrophy. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model  with Hedges' g effect size ({ES}). The methodological quality of studies was  appraised using the {TESTEX} checklist. Eleven good-to-excellent methodological  quality studies were included in the review. When all strength tests, that is,  both in multi-joint ({MJ}) and single-joint ({SJ}) exercises were considered, there  was no difference between the {EOs} ({ES} = -0.11; p = 0.306). However, there was a  difference between the {MJ}-to-{SJ} and {SJ}-to-{MJ} orders for strength gains in the {MJ}  exercises, favouring starting the exercise session with {MJ} exercises ({ES} = 0.32;  p = 0.034), and the strength gains in the {SJ} exercises, favouring starting the  exercise session with {SJ} exercises ({ES} = -0.58; p = 0.032). No significant effect  of {EO} was observed for hypertrophy combining site-specific and indirect measures  ({ES} = 0.03; p = 0.862). In conclusion, increases in muscular strength are the  largest in the exercises performed at the beginning of an exercise session. For  muscle hypertrophy, our meta-analysis indicated that both {MJ}-to-{SJ} and {SJ}-to-{MJ}  {EOs} may produce similar results.},

	abstract = {Sarcopenia is a generalised skeletal muscle disorder characterised by reduced muscle strength and mass and associated with a range of negative health outcomes.  Currently, resistance exercise ({RE}) is recommended as the first-line treatment  for counteracting the deleterious consequences of sarcopenia in older adults.  However, whilst there is considerable evidence demonstrating that {RE} is an  effective intervention for improving muscle strength and function in healthy  older adults, much less is known about its benefits in older people living with  sarcopenia. Furthermore, evidence for its optimal prescription and delivery is  very limited and any potential benefits of {RE} are unlikely to be realised in the  absence of an appropriate exercise dose. We provide a summary of the underlying  principles of effective {RE} prescription (specificity, overload and progression)  and discuss the main variables (training frequency, exercise selection, exercise  intensity, exercise volume and rest periods) that can be manipulated when  designing {RE} programmes. Following this, we propose that an {RE} programme that  consists of two exercise sessions per week and involves a combination of upper-  and lower-body exercises performed with a relatively high degree of effort for  1-3 sets of 6-12 repetitions is appropriate as a treatment for sarcopenia. The  principles of {RE} prescription outlined here and the proposed {RE} programme  presented in this paper provide a useful resource for clinicians and exercise  practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and will also be of value to  researchers for standardising approaches to {RE} interventions in future sarcopenia  studies.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNA}), small noncoding {RNA} molecules, may regulate protein synthesis, while resistance exercise training ({RT}) is an efficient strategy for stimulating  muscle protein synthesis in vivo. However, {RT} increases muscle mass, with a very  wide range of effectiveness in humans. We therefore determined the expression  level of 21 abundant {miRNAs} to determine whether variation in these {miRNAs} was  able to explain the variation in {RT}-induced gains in muscle mass. Vastus  lateralis biopsies were obtained from the top and bottom ∼20\% of responders from  56 young men who undertook a 5 day/wk {RT} program for 12 wk. Training-induced  muscle mass gain was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and fiber  size was evaluated by histochemistry. The expression level of each {miRNA} was  quantified using {TaqMan}-based quantitative {PCR}, with the analysis carried out in  a blinded manner. Gene ontology and target gene profiling were used to predict  the potential biological implications. Of the 21 mature {miRNAs} examined, 17 were  stable during {RT} in both groups. However, {miR}-378, {miR}-29a, {miR}-26a, and {miR}-451  were differentially expressed between low and high responders. {miR}-378, {miR}-29a,  and {miR}-26a were downregulated in low responders and unchanged in high  responders, while {miR}-451 was upregulated only in low responders. Interestingly,  the training-induced change in {miR}-378 abundance was positively correlated with  muscle mass gains in vivo. Gene ontology analysis of the target gene list of  {miR}-378, {miR}-29a, {miR}-26a, and {miR}-451, from the weighted cumulative context  ranking methodology, indicated that {miRNA} changes in the low responders may be  compensatory, reflecting a failure to "activate" growth and remodeling genes. We  report, for the first time, that {RT}-induced hypertrophy in human skeletal muscle  is associated with selected changes in {miRNA} abundance. Our analysis indicates  that {miRNAs} may play a role in the phenotypic change and pronounced intergroup  variation in the {RT} response.},

We found that in 2-year-old liver, 40\% of elongating {RNA} polymerases are stalled, lowering productive transcription and skewing transcriptional output in a gene-length-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that this transcriptional stress is caused by endogenous {DNA} damage and explains the majority of gene expression changes in aging in most mainly postmitotic organs, specifically affecting aging hallmark pathways such as nutrient sensing, autophagy, proteostasis, energy metabolism, immune function and cellular stress resilience. Age-related transcriptional stress is evolutionary conserved from nematodes to humans. Thus, accumulation of stochastic endogenous {DNA} damage during aging deteriorates basal transcription, which establishes the age-related transcriptome and causes dysfunction of key aging hallmark pathways, disclosing how {DNA} damage functionally underlies major aspects of normal aging.},

Understanding the molecular mechanism of {lncRNAs} underlying senescence could facilitate interpretation and intervention of aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we describe categories of known and novel {lncRNAs} that have been involved in the progression of senescence. We also identify the {lncRNAs} implicated in diseases arising from age-driven degeneration or dysfunction in some representative organs and systems (brains, liver, muscle, cardiovascular system, bone pancreatic islets, and immune system).

However, it remains unclear whether {IR} undergoes spatial or  temporal changes during different stages of aging or neurodegeneration like  Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). By profiling the transcriptome of Drosophila head cells  at different ages, we observed a significant increase in {IR} events for many genes  during aging. Differential {IR} affects distinct biological functions at different  ages and occurs at several {AD}-associated genes in older adults. The increased  nucleosome occupancy at the differentially retained introns in young animals  suggests that it may regulate the level of {IR} during aging. Notably, an increase  in the number of {IR} events was also observed in healthy older mouse and human  brain tissues, as well as in the cerebellum and frontal cortex from independent  {AD} cohorts. Genes with differential {IR} shared many common features, including  shorter intron length, no perturbation in their {mRNA} level, and enrichment for  biological functions that are associated with {mRNA} processing and proteostasis.  The differentially retained introns identified in {AD} frontal cortex have higher  {GC} content, with many of their {mRNA} transcripts showing an altered level of  protein expression compared to control samples. Taken together, our results  suggest that an increased {IR} is an conserved signature that is associated with  aging. By affecting pathways involved in {mRNA} and protein homeostasis, changes of  {IR} pattern during aging may regulate the transition from healthy to pathological  state in late-onset sporadic {AD}.},

	abstract = {Adult aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration of biological functions at physiological, cellular and molecular levels, but its damaging effects on the transcriptome are not well characterized. Here, by analyzing splicing patterns in ∼1,000 human subjects sampled across multiple tissues, we found that splicing fidelity declines with age. Most prominently, genuine introns fail to be spliced out, manifesting as a broad surge in intron retention, and this is exacerbated by the increase in diverse spurious exon-exon junctions with age. Both of these effects are prominently detected in the majority of human tissues. Collectively, they result in the progressive deterioration of the active transcriptome, wherein functional {mRNAs} are increasingly diluted with non-functional splicing isoforms. We discuss the concept of “splicing damage” and formulate methods to quantify it. Using these tools, we show that splicing damage increases both with age and with the incidence of diseases. Altogether, this work uncovers transcriptome damage as a critical molecular indicator of human aging and healthspan.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

Functions associated with the age-{lncRNAs},  including immune system processes and transcription, were similar to what has  previously been reported for protein coding genes with ageing-associated  expression pattern. As the tissue-specific age-{lncRNAs} were associated with  shared functions across tissues, they may reflect the tissue-specific fine-tuning  of the common ageing-associated processes.

This study investigated transcriptional networks  linked to {RT}-induced muscle hypertrophy, classified as 1) predictive of  hypertrophy, 2) responsive to {RT} independent of muscle hypertrophy, or 3) plastic  with hypertrophy. Older adults (n = 31, 18 F/13 M, 70 ± 4 yr) underwent 14-wk {RT}  (3 days/wk, alternating high-low-high intensity). Muscle hypertrophy was assessed  by pre- to post-{RT} change in mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area ({CSA})  [computed tomography ({CT}), primary outcome] and thigh lean mass [dual-energy  X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA}), secondary outcome]. Transcriptome-wide poly-A {RNA}-seq  was performed on vastus lateralis tissue collected pre- (n = 31) and post-{RT} (n =  22). Prediction networks (using only baseline {RNA}-seq) were identified by  weighted gene correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}). To identify Plasticity  networks, {WGCNA} change indices for paired samples were calculated and correlated  to changes in muscle size outcomes. Pathway-level information extractor ({PLIER})  was applied to identify Response networks and link genes to biological  annotation. Prediction networks (n = 6) confirmed transcripts previously  connected to resistance/aerobic training adaptations in the {MetaMEx} database  while revealing novel member genes that should fuel future research to understand  the influence of baseline muscle gene expression on hypertrophy. Response  networks (n = 6) indicated {RT}-induced increase in aerobic metabolism and reduced  expression of genes associated with spliceosome biology and type-I myofibers. A  single exploratory Plasticity network was identified. Findings support that  interindividual differences in baseline gene expression may contribute more than  {RT}-induced changes in gene networks to muscle hypertrophic response  heterogeneity.

Vastus lateralis biopsies were  obtained pre- and 4 h post-{RE} in conjunction with the 1st and 36th (last)  training session as part of a 12-wk {PRT} program in study A, whereas biopsies were  obtained in the basal untrained state in study B. Additionally, the muscle fiber  type specific ({MHC} I and {MHC} {IIa}) Transcriptome response to {RE} was examined in a  subset of young and old women from study A. Transcriptome profiling was performed  using {HG} U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The main findings were 1) there were 661 genes  affected by {RE} during the 1st and 36th training bout that correlated with gains  in muscle size and strength with {PRT} (termed the Transcriptome signature of  resistance exercise adaptations); 2) the {RE} gene response was most pronounced in  fast-twitch ({MHC} {IIa}) muscle fibers and provided additional insight into the  skeletal muscle biology affected by {RE}; 3) skeletal muscle of young adults is  more responsive to {RE} at the gene level compared with old adults and age also  affected basal level skeletal muscle gene expression. These skeletal muscle  Transcriptome findings provide further insight into the molecular basis of  sarcopenia and the impact of resistance exercise at the mixed muscle and fiber  type specific level.},

We found that metformin blunted  {PRT}-induced muscle hypertrophic response. To understand potential mechanisms  underlying the inhibitory effect of metformin on {PRT}, we analyzed the muscle  transcriptome in 23 {metPRT} and 24 {plaPRT} participants. {PRT} significantly  increased expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling  pathways, and downregulated {RNA} processing pathways in both groups, however,  metformin attenuated the number of differentially expressed genes within these  pathways compared to {plaPRT}. Pathway analysis showed that genes unique to {metPRT}  modulated aging-relevant pathways, such as cellular senescence and autophagy.  Differentially expressed genes from baseline biopsies in older adults compared to  resting muscle from young volunteers were reduced following {PRT} in {plaPRT} and  were further reduced in {metPRT}. We suggest that although metformin may blunt  pathways induced by {PRT} to promote muscle hypertrophy, adjunctive metformin  during {PRT} may have beneficial effects on aging-associated pathways in muscle  from older adults.},

Intron retention, a type of alternative splicing, may control gene expression. We examined intron retention in dystrophin introns by reverse-transcription {PCR} from skeletal muscle, focusing on the nine shortest (all {\textless}1000 bp), because these are more likely to be retained. Only one, intron 40, was retained in {mRNA}; sequencing revealed insertion of a complete intron 40 (851 nt) between exons 40 and 41. The intron 40 retention product accounted for 1.2\% of the total product but had a premature stop codon at the fifth intronic codon. Intron 40 retention was most strongly observed in the kidney (36.6\%) and was not obtained from the fetal liver, lung, spleen or placenta. This indicated that intron retention is a tissue-specific event whose level varies among tissues. In two {DMD} patients, intron 40 retention was observed in one patient but not in the other. Examination of splicing regulatory factors revealed that intron 40 had the highest guanine–cytosine content of all examined introns in a 30-nt segment at its 3′ end. Further studies are needed to clarify the biological role of intron 40-retained dystrophin {mRNA}.},

However, it is unclear whether splicing efficiency of introns within the same gene is coordinated and eventually regulated as a mechanism to control mature {mRNA} levels. Based on nascent chromatin-associated {RNA}-sequencing data, we now find that co-transcriptional splicing ({CTS}) efficiency tends to be similar between the different introns of a gene. We establish that two well-differentiated strategies for {CTS} efficiency exist, at the extremes of a gradient: short genes that produce high levels of pre-{mRNA} undergo inefficient splicing, while long genes with relatively low levels of pre-{mRNA} have an efficient splicing. Notably, we observe that genes with efficient {CTS} display a higher level of mature {mRNA} relative to their pre-{mRNA} levels. Further, we show that the {TGFβ} signal transduction pathway regulates the general {CTS} efficiency, causing changes in mature {mRNA} levels. Taken together, our data indicate that {CTS} efficiency is a gene-specific characteristic that can be regulated to control gene expression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) are prone to accelerated decay of muscle strength and mass with advancing age. This is  believed to be driven by disease-inherent systemic pathophysiologies, which are  also assumed to drive muscle cells into a state of anabolic resistance, leading  to impaired abilities to adapt to resistance exercise training. Currently, this  phenomenon remains largely unstudied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the  assumed negative effects of {COPD} for health- and muscle-related responsiveness to  resistance training using a healthy control-based translational approach.  {METHODS}: Subjects with {COPD} (n = 20, {GOLD} {II}-{III}, {FEV}(1predicted) 57 ± 11\%, age  69 ± 5) and healthy controls (Healthy, n = 58, {FEV}(1predicted) 112 ± 16\%, age  67 ± 4) conducted identical whole-body resistance training interventions for  13 weeks, consisting of two weekly supervised training sessions. Leg exercises  were performed unilaterally, with one leg conducting high-load training (10RM)  and the contralateral leg conducting low-load training (30RM). Measurements  included muscle strength (n(variables) = 7), endurance performance  (n(variables) = 6), muscle mass (n(variables) = 3), muscle quality, muscle  biology (m. vastus lateralis; muscle fiber characteristics, {RNA} content including  transcriptome) and health variables (body composition, blood). For core outcome  domains, weighted combined factors were calculated from the range of singular  assessments. {RESULTS}: {COPD} displayed well-known pathophysiologies at baseline,  including elevated levels of systemic low-grade inflammation ([c-reactive  protein](serum)), reduced muscle mass and functionality, and muscle biological  aberrancies. Despite this, resistance training led to improved lower-limb muscle  strength (15 ± 8\%), muscle mass (7 ± 5\%), muscle quality (8 ± 8\%) and  lower-limb/whole-body endurance performance (26 ± 12\%/8 ± 9\%) in {COPD}, resembling  or exceeding responses in Healthy, measured in both relative and numeric change  terms. Within the {COPD} cluster, lower {FEV}(1predicted) was associated with larger  numeric and relative increases in muscle mass and superior relative improvements  in maximal muscle strength. This was accompanied by similar changes in hallmarks  of muscle biology such as {rRNA}-content↑, muscle fiber cross-sectional area↑, type  {IIX} proportions↓, and changes in {mRNA} transcriptomics. Neither of the core  outcome domains were differentially affected by resistance training load.  {CONCLUSIONS}: {COPD} showed hitherto largely unrecognized responsiveness to  resistance training, rejecting the notion of disease-related impairments and  rather advocating such training as a potent measure to relieve pathophysiologies.  {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {ClinicalTrials}.gov {ID}: {NCT}02598830.

	abstract = {Despite advances in treatments and therapies, cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}) remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The discovery that most of the human genome, although transcribed, does not encode proteins was crucial for focusing on the potential of long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) as essential regulators of cell function at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. This class of non-coding {RNAs} is related to the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. The different expression profiles of {lncRNAs}, in different contexts of {CVDs}, change a great potential in their use as a biomarker and targets of therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, regular physical exercise plays a protective role against {CVDs}; on the other hand, little is known about its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review, we look at the accumulated knowledge on {lncRNAs} and their functions in the cardiovascular system, focusing on the cardiovascular pathology of arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. We discuss the potential of these molecules as biomarkers for clinical use, their limitations, and how the manipulation of the expression profile of these transcripts through physical exercise can begin to be suggested as a strategy for the treatment of {CVDs}.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide studies of aging have identified subsets of genes that show age-related changes in expression. Although the types of genes that are age regulated vary among different tissues and organisms, some patterns emerge from these large data sets. First, aging is associated with a broad induction of stress response pathways, although the specific genes and pathways involved differ depending on cell type and species. In contrast, a wide variety of functional classes of genes are downregulated with age, often including tissue-specific genes. Although the upregulation of age-regulated genes is likely to be governed by stress-responsive transcription factors, questions remain as to why particular genes are susceptible to age-related transcriptional decline. Here, we discuss recent findings showing that splicing is misregulated with age. While defects in splicing could lead to changes in protein isoform levels, they could also impact gene expression through nonsense-mediated decay of intron-retained transcripts. The discovery that splicing is misregulated with age suggests that other aspects of gene expression, such as transcription elongation, termination, and polyadenylation, must also be considered as potential mechanisms for age-related changes in transcript levels. Moreover, the considerable variation between genome-wide aging expression studies indicates that there is a critical need to analyze the transcriptional signatures of aging in single-cell types rather than whole tissues. Since age-associated decreases in gene expression could contribute to a progressive decline in cellular function, understanding the mechanisms that determine the aging transcriptome provides a potential target to extend healthy cellular lifespan.},

For example, the minor spliceosome component {ZRSR}2 is subject to recurrent, leukemia-associated mutations, yet functional connections among minor introns, hematopoiesis and cancers are unclear. Here, we identify that impaired minor intron excision via {ZRSR}2 loss enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. {CRISPR} screens mimicking nonsense-mediated decay of minor intron-containing {mRNA} species converged on {LZTR}1, a regulator of {RAS}-related {GTPases}. {LZTR}1 minor intron retention was also discovered in the {RASopathy} Noonan syndrome, due to intronic mutations disrupting splicing and diverse solid tumors. These data uncover minor intron recognition as a regulator of hematopoiesis, noncoding mutations within minor introns as potential cancer drivers and links among {ZRSR}2 mutations, {LZTR}1 regulation and leukemias.},

Using publicly available data on short-hairpin {RNA}-knockdowns of  numerous spliceosomal components and related regulators, we found support for the  importance of {RNA}-binding proteins in mis-splicing. We also demonstrated that age  is positively correlated with mis-splicing, and it affects genes implicated in  neurodegenerative diseases. This in-depth characterisation of mis-splicing can  have important implications for our understanding of the role of splicing  inaccuracies in human disease and the interpretation of long-read {RNA}-sequencing  data.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing changes are closely linked to aging, though it remains unclear if they are drivers or effects. As organisms age, splicing patterns  change, varying gene isoform levels and functions. These changes may contribute  to aging alterations rather than just reflect declining {RNA} quality control.  Three main splicing types-intron retention, cassette exons, and cryptic  exons-play key roles in age-related complexity. These events modify protein  domains and increase nonsense-mediated decay, shifting protein isoform levels and  functions. This may potentially drive aging or serve as a biomarker. Fluctuations  in splicing factor expression also occur with aging. Somatic mutations in  splicing genes can also promote aging and age-related disease. The interplay  between splicing and aging has major implications for aging biology, though  differentiating correlation and causation remains challenging. Declaring a  splicing factor or event as a driver requires comprehensive evaluation of the  associated molecular and physiological changes. A greater understanding of how  {RNA} splicing machinery and downstream targets are impacted by aging is essential  to conclusively establish the role of splicing in driving aging, representing a  promising area with key implications for understanding aging, developing novel  therapeutical options, and ultimately leading to an increase in the healthy human  lifespan.},

Gain-of-function assays were conducted to reveal roles of {MEF}2C-{AS}1 and {MEF}2C in {CC} cell behaviors.

	abstract = {Previous studies proved that long noncoding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) play important role in human cancer. However, the knowledge of genome scale expression of {lncRNAs} and their potential biological function in gastric cancer is still lacking. Next generation {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) was performed on tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues of six diffuse gastric cancer ({DGC}) patients. Then we performed a comprehensive analysis on {lncRNAs} and {mRNA}. Fifty-eight {lncRNAs} were upregulated and 54 {lncRNAs} were downregulated in diffuse gastric cancer tissue compared with adjacent tissue. The numbers of up- and downregulated {mRNAs} were 306 and 161, respectively. In addition, we inferred the function of {lncRNAs} by construction of a co-expression network for deregulated {mRNAs} and {lncRNAs}. Co-expressed genes of {MEF}2C-{AS}1 and {FENDRR} were enriched to {RAS} and {TGF}-beta signaling pathway. {MEF}2C-{AS}1 and {FENDRR} expression were re-evaluated by Real-time Quantitative {PCR} in 42 {DGC} patients' tumor and normal tissues, and other 46 {DGC} patents' and 21 healthy controls' plasma. Validation data showed {MEF}2C-{AS}1 and {FENDRR} were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. And decreased {FENDRR} are associated with aggressive tumor characteristics including more advanced stage (P = .030), poor differentiation (P = .043) and lymphatic metastasis (P = .001). The expression level {MEF}2C-{AS}1 was significantly lower in {DGC} patients' plasma than that in healthy controls' plasma. In gastric cancer cell lines, knock-down of {MEF}2C-{AS}1 or {FENDRR} reduced the protein levels of {FAT}3, {NTN}1 and {LYVE}1 (the co-expressed genes), which were related with gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by previous studies. In addition, knock-down of {MEF}2C-{AS}1 or {FENDRR} promoted aggressive tumor behaviors in in-vitro assays. In this study, we provide a valuable resource of {lncRNAs} which might play important roles in the function of oncogenes or tumor suppressors affecting the development and progression of diffuse gastric cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Growing studies have reported that pseudogenes play key roles in multiple human cancers. However, expression and roles of pseudogenes in renal  cell carcinoma remains absent. {RESULTS}: 31 upregulated and 16 downregulated  pseudogenes were screened. Higher expression of {DUXAP}8 and {DUXAP}9 indicated  poorer prognosis of kidney cancer. 33 and 5 {miRNAs} were predicted to potentially  binding to {DUXAP}8 and {DUXAP}9, respectively. {miR}-29c-3p was identified as the most  potential binding {miRNAs} of {DUXAP}8 and {DUXAP}9 based on expression, survival and  correlation analyses. 254 target genes of {miR}-29c-3p were forecast. 47 hub genes  with node degree {\textgreater}= 10 were identified. Subsequent analysis for the top 10 hub  genes demonstrated that {COL}1A1 and {COL}1A2 may be two functional targets of {DUXAP}8  and {DUXAP}9. Expression of {DUXAP}8, {DUXAP}9, {COL}1A1 and {COL}1A2 were significantly  increased in cancer samples compared to normal controls while {miR}-29c-3p  expression was decreased. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that {miR}-29c-3p  could directly bind to {DUXAP}8, {DUXAP}9, {COL}1A1 and {COL}1A2. Functional experiments  showed that {DUXAP}8 and {DUXAP}9 enhanced but {miR}-29c-3p weakened growth of renal  cell carcinoma. {CONCLUSIONS}: In conclusion, upregulated {DUXAP}8 and {DUXAP}9 promote  growth of renal cell carcinoma and serve as two promising prognostic biomarkers.  {METHODS}: Dysregulated pseudogenes were obtained by {dreamBase} and {GEPIA}.

Using this method, we were able to identify numerous cell-type  specific and functionally enriched correlated gene modules. We confirmed through  knockdown that a module enriched for p53 signaling predicted p53 regulatory  targets more accurately than a consensus of {ChIP}-seq studies and that  steady-state correlations were predictive of transcriptome-wide response patterns  to perturbations.

	abstract = {Human skeletal muscle responds to weight-bearing exercise with significant inter-individual differences. Investigation of transcriptome responses could improve our understanding of this variation. However, this requires bioinformatic pipelines to be established and evaluated in study-specific contexts. Skeletal muscle subjected to mechanical stress, such as through resistance training ({RT}), accumulates {RNA} due to increased ribosomal biogenesis. When a fixed amount of total-{RNA} is used for {RNA}-seq library preparations, {mRNA} counts are thus assessed in different amounts of tissue, potentially invalidating subsequent conclusions. The purpose of this study was to establish a bioinformatic pipeline specific for analysis of {RNA}-seq data from skeletal muscles, to explore the effects of different normalization strategies and to identify genes responding to {RT} in a volume-dependent manner (moderate vs. low volume). To this end, we analyzed {RNA}-seq data derived from a twelve-week {RT} intervention, wherein 25 participants performed both low- and moderate-volume leg {RT}, allocated to the two legs in a randomized manner. Bilateral muscle biopsies were sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after the intervention, as well as before and after the fifth training session (Week 2).},

Nursing home residents with a  history of falls had less than half of the knee and ankle strength of nonfalling  subjects residing in the same home. The differences were more prominent at the  ankle than the knee, and were most pronounced in the ankle dorsiflexors, where  they were one-tenth that of controls. Also of note was the fact that this same  group of fallers had slowed gait velocity (58\% of control) as well as an impaired  response to postural perturbation as determined on the Postural Stress Test (55\%  of control). In a recently completed study we measured strength as balance  ({EquiTest} balance platform) of community-dwelling subjects. The occurrence of  loss of balance during the sensory organization test was correlated with  diminished lower extremity (Pearson R = -.36, p = .001) as well as ankle dorsi  and plantar flexion moments (Pearson R = -.37, p = .001). Using a logistic  regression model, we demonstrated an independent effect of strength on the odds  ratio of an {SOT}-{LOB}; for each newtonmeter per kg increase in strength there was a  20\% decrease (95\% {CI}, .74-87) in the odds ratio. The data from both nursing home  and community-dwelling subjects indicate a strong relationship of lower extremity  strength to balance and gait.

Interestingly, {lncRNAs} are not limited to a defined set of functions but can regulate varied activities such as messenger {RNA} degradation, translation, and protein kinetics or function as {RNA} decoys or scaffolds. Although still in its infancy, research into the biology of {lncRNAs} has demonstrated the importance of {lncRNAs} in development and disease. However, the specific mechanisms through which these {lncRNAs} act remain poorly defined.

Ribosome abundance and biogenesis markers were assessed from vastus  lateralis biopsies obtained at baseline, 48 hours after sessions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9  and 12, and after eight days of de-training, and from a control group (n = 8).  Muscle thickness was measured before and after the intervention. {RESULTS}:  Training led to muscle growth (3.9\% over baseline values, 95\% {CrI}: [0.2, 7.5] vs.  control) with concomitant increases in total {RNA}, ribosomal {RNA}, upstream binding  factor ({UBF}) and ribosomal protein S6 with no differences between volume  conditions. Total {RNA} increased rapidly in response to the first four sessions  (8.6\% [5.6, 11.7] per session), followed by a plateau and peak values after  session 8 (49.5\% [34.5, 66.5] above baseline). Total {RNA} abundance was associated  with {UBF} protein levels (5.0\% [0.2, 10.2] per unit {UBF}), and the rate of increase  in total {RNA} levels predicted hypertrophy (0.3 mm [0.1, 0.4] per \%-point increase  in total {RNA} per session). After de-training, total {RNA} decreased (-19.3\% [-29.0,  -8.1]) without muscle mass changes indicating halted biosynthesis of ribosomes.  {CONCLUSION}: Ribosomes accumulate in the initial phase of resistance training with  abundances sensitive to training cessation and associated with {UBF} protein  levels. The average accumulation rate predicts muscle training-induced  hypertrophy.},

Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of {lncRNAs} is distinct from that of {mRNAs} and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with {DNA}, {RNA} and proteins, {lncRNAs} can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic {mRNAs} and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that {lncRNAs} are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically.

Most {lncRNAs} evolve more rapidly than protein-coding sequences, are cell type specific and regulate many aspects of cell differentiation and development and other physiological processes. Many {lncRNAs} associate with chromatin-modifying complexes, are transcribed from enhancers and nucleate phase separation of nuclear condensates and domains, indicating an intimate link between {lncRNA} expression and the spatial control of gene expression during development. {lncRNAs} also have important roles in the cytoplasm and beyond, including in the regulation of translation, metabolism and signalling. {lncRNAs} often have a modular structure and are rich in repeats, which are increasingly being shown to be relevant to their function. In this Consensus Statement, we address the definition and nomenclature of {lncRNAs} and their conservation, expression, phenotypic visibility, structure and functions. We also discuss research challenges and provide recommendations to advance the understanding of the roles of {lncRNAs} in development, cell biology and disease.},

The mesoderm is  organized into paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm. The  musculature, vasculature and heart of the adult body are the major derivatives of  mesoderm. Tracing back the developmental process to generate these specialized  tissues has sparked much interest in the field of regenerative medicine focusing  on generating specialized tissues to treat patients with degenerative diseases.  Several Long Non-Coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) have been identified as regulators of  development, proliferation and differentiation of various tissues of mesodermal  origin. A better understanding of {lncRNAs} that can regulate the development of  these tissues will open potential avenues for their therapeutic utility and  enhance our knowledge about disease progression and development.

Long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) have emerged as an  {RNA} class with regulatory functions in health and diseases. Here, we analyzed the  expression of {lncRNAs} after different exercise training programs and their  possible modes of action related to physical exercise adaptations. {METHODS}:  Public high-throughput {RNA}-seq data (skeletal muscle biopsies) were downloaded,  and bioinformatics analysis was performed. We primarily analyzed data reports of  12 weeks of resistance training ({RT}), high-intensity interval training ({HIIT}),  and combined ({CT}) exercise training. In addition, we analyzed data from 8 weeks  of endurance training ({ET}). Differential expression analysis of {lncRNAs} was  performed, and an adjusted P-value {\textless} 0.1 and log2 (fold change) ≥0.5 or ≤-0.5  were set as the cutoff values to identify differentially expressed {lncRNAs}  ({DELs}). {RESULTS}: We identified 204 {DELs} after 12 weeks of {HIIT}, 43 {DELs} after {RT},  and 15 {DELs} after {CT}. Moreover, 52 {lncRNAs} were differentially expressed after 8  weeks of {ET}. The {lncRNA} expression pattern after physical exercise was very  specific, with distinct expression profiles for the different training programs,  where few {lncRNAs} were common among the exercise types. {LncRNAs} may regulate  molecular responses to exercise, such as collagen fibril organization,  extracellular matrix organization, myoblast and plasma membrane fusion, skeletal  muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, {PI}3K and {TORC} regulation, autophagy,  and angiogenesis. {CONCLUSION}: For the first time, we show that {lncRNAs} are  differentially expressed in skeletal muscle after different physical exercise  programs, and these {lncRNAs} may act in various biological processes related to  physical activity adaptations.},

Recent  studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of {lncRNAs} is distinct from that  of {mRNAs} and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and  functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with  {DNA}, {RNA} and proteins, {lncRNAs} can modulate chromatin function, regulate the  assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and  translation of cytoplasmic {mRNAs} and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of  these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and  physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and  cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that  {lncRNAs} are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them  clinically.

Exercise training enabled the skeletal muscle to counteract age-related sarcopenia by inducing a wide range of adaptations, sustained by the expression of protein-coding genes involved in energy handling, proteostasis, cytoskeletal organization, inflammation control, and cellular senescence. Building on the previous study, we examined here the network of non-coding {RNAs} participating in the orchestration of gene expression and identified differentially expressed micro- and long-non-coding {RNAs} and some of their possible targets and roles. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses of all non-coding {RNAs} were able to discriminate between sedentary and trained individuals, regardless of the exercise typology. Validated targets of differentially expressed {miRNA} were grouped by {KEGG} analysis, which pointed to functional areas involved in cell cycle, cytoskeletal control, longevity, and many signaling pathways, including {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) and mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}), which had been shown to be pivotal in the modulation of the effects of high-intensity, life-long exercise training.

Increased  abundance of Cerox1 cooperatively elevates complex I subunit protein abundance  and enzymatic activity, decreases reactive oxygen species production, and  protects against the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Cerox1 function is conserved  across placental mammals: human and mouse orthologues effectively modulate  complex I enzymatic activity in mouse and human cells, respectively.

Data  were pooled where appropriate. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: One hundred and twenty one trials  with 6700 participants were included. In most trials, {PRT} was performed two to  three times per week and at a high intensity. {PRT} resulted in a small but  significant improvement in physical ability (33 trials, 2172 participants; {SMD}  0.14, 95\% {CI} 0.05 to 0.22). Functional limitation measures also showed  improvements: e.g. there was a modest improvement in gait speed (24 trials, 1179  participants, {MD} 0.08 m/s, 95\% {CI} 0.04 to 0.12); and a moderate to large effect  for getting out of a chair (11 trials, 384 participants, {SMD} -0.94, 95\% {CI} -1.49  to -0.38). {PRT} had a large positive effect on muscle strength (73 trials, 3059  participants, {SMD} 0.84, 95\% {CI} 0.67 to 1.00). Participants with osteoarthritis  reported a reduction in pain following {PRT}(6 trials, 503 participants, {SMD} -0.30,  95\% {CI} -0.48 to -0.13). There was no evidence from 10 other trials (587  participants) that {PRT} had an effect on bodily pain. Adverse events were poorly  recorded but adverse events related to musculoskeletal complaints, such as joint  pain and muscle soreness, were reported in many of the studies that prospectively  defined and monitored these events. Serious adverse events were rare, and no  serious events were reported to be directly related to the exercise programme.  {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: This review provides evidence that {PRT} is an effective  intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including  improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities.  However, some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with  clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported.},

Our intensive studies of {lncRNAs} provide diverse potential mechanisms of {lncRNAs} that regulate gene expression through binding enhancers and 3′-{UTRs} of genes, competing for {miRNA} binding sites with {mRNAs}, recruiting the transcription factors to gene promoters. Furthermore, we investigated {lncRNAs} that potentially affect the alternative splicing events through interacting with {RNA} binding Proteins. We also performed multiple functional annotations including cancer stage-associated {lncRNAs}, {RNA} A-to-I editing event-associated {lncRNAs}, and {lncRNA} expression quantitative trait loci. {lncRNAfunc} is a unique resource for cancer research communities to help better understand potential {lncRNA} regulations and therapeutic {lncRNA} targets.},

Mounting evidence has suggested that long noncoding {RNAs}  ({lncRNAs}) are involved in stress responses to internal and environmental stimuli.  However, the underlying molecular interactions remain to be elucidated. In this  study, we performed integrative analyses of {lncRNA}-{mRNA} coexpression in the  transformed human bronchial epithelial {BEAS}-2B cell line exposed to {DMSe}-derived  {SOA}. We identified a total of 971 differentially expressed {lncRNAs} in {BEAS}-2B  cells exposed to {SOA} derived from O(3) and {OH} oxidation of {DMSe}. Gene ontology  ({GO}) network analysis of cis-targeted genes showed significant enrichment of {DNA}  damage, apoptosis, and p53-mediated stress response pathways. trans-Acting  {lncRNAs}, including {PINCR}, {PICART}1, {DLGAP}1-{AS}2, and {LINC}01629, known to be  associated with human carcinogenesis, also showed altered expression in cell  treated with {DMSe}-{SOA}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lifestyle therapy with resistance training is a potent measure to counteract age-related loss in muscle strength and mass. Unfortunately, many  individuals fail to respond in the expected manner. This phenomenon is  particularly common among older adults and those with chronic diseases (e.g.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {COPD}) and may involve endocrine variables  such as vitamin D. At present, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on  responses to resistance training remain largely unexplored. {METHODS}: Ninety-five  male and female participants (healthy, n = 71; {COPD}, n = 24; age 68 ± 5 years)  were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D(3) or placebo supplementation  for 28 weeks in a double-blinded manner (latitude 61°N, September-May).  Seventy-eight participants completed the {RCT}, which was initiated by 12 weeks of  supplementation-only (two weeks with 10 000 {IU}/day, followed by 2000 {IU}/day),  followed by 13 weeks of combined supplementation (2000 {IU}/day) and supervised  whole-body resistance training (twice weekly), interspersed with testing and  measurements. Outcome measures included multiple assessments of muscle strength  (n(variables)  = 7), endurance performance (n = 6), and muscle mass (n = 3, legs,  primary), as well as muscle quality (legs), muscle biology (m. vastus lateralis;  muscle fibre characteristics, transcriptome), and health-related variables (e.g.  visceral fat mass and blood lipid profile). For main outcome domains such as  muscle strength and muscle mass, weighted combined factors were calculated from  the range of singular assessments. {RESULTS}: Overall, 13 weeks of resistance  training increased muscle strength (13\% ± 8\%), muscle mass (9\% ± 8\%), and  endurance performance (one-legged, 23\% ± 15\%; whole-body, 8\% ± 7\%), assessed as  weighted combined factors, and were associated with changes in health variables  (e.g. visceral fat, -6\% ± 21\%; [{LDL}](serum) , -4\% ± 14\%) and muscle tissue  characteristics such as fibre type proportions (e.g. {IIX}, -3\% points), myonuclei  per fibre (30\% ± 65\%), total {RNA}/{rRNA} abundances (15\%/6-19\%), and transcriptome  profiles (e.g. 312 differentially expressed genes). Vitamin D(3) supplementation  did not affect training-associated changes for any of the main outcome domains,  despite robust increases in [25({OH})D](serum) (∆49\% vs. placebo). No conditional  effects were observed for {COPD} vs. healthy or pre-{RCT} [25({OH})D](serum) . In  secondary analyses, vitamin D(3) affected expression of gene sets involved in  vascular functions in muscle tissue and strength gains in participants with high  fat mass, which advocates further study. {CONCLUSIONS}: Vitamin D(3)  supplementation did not affect muscular responses to resistance training in older  adults with or without {COPD}.},

	abstract = {{KEY} {POINTS}: For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate  responses. This remains unexplored. Here, 34 untrained individuals performed  contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12 weeks.  Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength  and type {II} fibre-type transitions. These changes coincided with greater  activation of signalling pathways controlling muscle growth and greater induction  of ribosome synthesis. Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit  of {MOD} on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of {MOD} on muscle  strength gains. This coincided with greater total {RNA} accumulation in the early  phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the  dose-response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy. These  results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training  volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume  were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis. {ABSTRACT}:  Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all  individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy  individuals (males n = 16, 23.6 (4.1) years; females n = 18, 22.0 (1.3) years)  performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, {MOD}) and low-volume (1 set, {LOW})  resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12 weeks (2-3 sessions per  week). Muscle cross-sectional area ({CSA}) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0  and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were  also sampled before and 1 h after the fifth session (Week 2). {MOD} resulted in  larger increases in muscle {CSA} (5.2 (3.8)\% versus 3.7 (3.7)\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and  strength (3.4-7.7\% difference, all P {\textless} 0.05. This coincided with greater  reductions in type {IIX} fibres from Week 0 to Week 12 ({MOD}, -4.6 percentage  points; {LOW} -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase 1 (p85  S6K1(Thr412) , 19\%; p70 S6K1(Thr389) , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6(Ser235/236)  (37\%), greater rested-state total {RNA} (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc  {mRNA} expression (25\%; Week 2, all P {\textless} 0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants,  respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to {MOD} on muscle hypertrophy  and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total {RNA} at  Week 2 in the {MOD} leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of {MOD}  benefit by 7.0\% (P = 0.005) and 9.8\% (P = 0.002). In conclusion, {MOD} led to  greater functional and biological adaptations than {LOW}. Associations between  dose-dependent total {RNA} accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength  point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training  responses.},

	abstract = {Ageing is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life. Although major categories of ageing damage have been identified—such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis and eroded mitochondrial function1—these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs, and a comprehensive, whole-organism analysis of ageing dynamics has been lacking. Here we performed bulk {RNA} sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the lifespan of Mus musculus, and integrated these findings with data from the accompanying Tabula Muris Senis2—or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—which follows on from the original Tabula Muris3. We reveal linear and nonlinear shifts in gene expression during ageing, with the associated genes clustered in consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions—including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Notably, these gene sets show similar expression across tissues, differing only in the amplitude and the age of onset of expression. Widespread activation of immune cells is especially pronounced, and is first detectable in white adipose depots during middle age. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing confirms the accumulation of T cells and B cells in adipose tissue—including plasma cells that express immunoglobulin J—which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how gene expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to the ageing of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of ageing, providing a foundation from which to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.},

While progressive  resistance training ({PRT}) improves muscle weakness, the effects on muscle  morphology remain inconclusive. This investigation evaluated the effects of a {PRT}  program on lower limb muscle strength, morphology and gross motor function.  Forty-nine children with spastic cerebral palsy were randomized by minimization.  The intervention group (nparticipants = 26, age: 8.3 ± 2.0 years, Gross Motor  Function Classification System [{GMFCS}] level I/{II}/{III}: 17/5/4, nlegs = 41)  received a 12-week {PRT} program, consisting of 3-4 sessions per week, with  exercises performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions, aiming at 60\%-80\% of the  1-repetition maximum. Training sessions were performed under supervision with the  physiotherapist and at home. The control group (nparticipants = 22, age: 8.5 ±  2.1 year, {GMFCS} level I/{II}/{III}: 14/5/3, nlegs = 36) continued usual care  including regular physiotherapy and use of orthotics. We assessed pre- and  post-training knee extension, knee flexion and plantar flexion isometric  strength, rectus femoris, semitendinosus and medial gastrocnemius muscle  morphology, as well as functional strength, gross motor function and walking  capacity. Data processing was performed blinded. Linear mixed models were applied  to evaluate the difference in evolution over time between the control and  intervention group (interaction-effect) and within each group (time-effect). The  α-level was set at p = 0.01. Knee flexion strength and unilateral heel raises  showed a significant interaction-effect (p ≤ 0.008), with improvements in the  intervention group (p ≤ 0.001). Moreover, significant time-effects were seen for  knee extension and plantar flexion isometric strength, rectus femoris and medial  gastrocnemius {MV}, sit-to-stand and lateral step-up in the intervention group (p ≤  0.004). Echo-intensity, muscle lengths and gross motor function showed limited to  no changes. {PRT} improved strength and {MV} in the intervention group, whereby  strength parameters significantly or close to significantly differed from the  control group. Although, relative improvements in strength were larger than  improvements in {MV}, important effects were seen on the maintenance of muscle size  relative to skeletal growth. In conclusion, this study proved the effectiveness  of a home-based, physiotherapy supervised, {PRT} program to improve isometric and  functional muscle strength in children with {SCP} without negative effects on  muscle properties or any serious adverse events.

Measurements were taken twice before training to estimate individual  day-to-day variations and measurement errors (n = 208). The individual  responsiveness to the 21-week {RT} in cardiometabolic health indicators (ie,  systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({HDL}-C),  cholesterol and triglycerides) was determined. Body composition was estimated by  bioimpedance and dietary intake according to 4-day food diaries. {RESULTS}:  Metabolic responses to {RT} seemed to be highly individual, and both beneficial and  unfavorable changes were observed. Large inter-individual variations in training  response were not explained by a subject's age, sex, body composition, or  nutritional status, with the exception of improvements in {HDL}-C, which were  associated with simultaneous decreases in body fat in older women. The incidence  of metabolic syndrome diminished following {RT}. {CONCLUSION}: This study showed that  {RT} could improve some specific metabolic health indicators beyond normal  day-to-day variations, especially in blood lipid profile. Further studies are  needed to elucidate genetic and other mechanisms underlining the heterogeneity of  {RT} responses. This knowledge may be useful in providing individually tailored  exercise prescriptions as part of personalized preventative health care.},

	abstract = {Considerable inter-individual heterogeneity exists in the muscular adaptations to resistance training. It has been proposed that fast-twitch fibers are more  sensitive to hypertrophic stimuli and thus that variation in muscle fiber type  composition is a contributing factor to the magnitude of training response. This  study investigated if the inter-individual variability in resistance training  adaptations is determined by muscle typology and if the most appropriate weekly  training frequency depends on muscle typology. In strength-training novices, 11  slow ({ST}) and 10 fast typology ({FT}) individuals were selected by measuring muscle  carnosine with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants trained both  upper arm and leg muscles to failure at 60\% 1RM for 10 weeks, whereby one arm and  leg trained 3x/week, the contralateral arm and leg 2x/week. Muscle volume  ({MRI}-based 3D segmentation), maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum,  1RM) and fiber-type specific cross-sectional area (vastus lateralis biopsies)  were evaluated. The training response for total muscle volume (+3 to +14\%), fiber  size (-19 to +22\%) and strength (+17 to +47\%) showed considerable  inter-individual variability, but these could not be attributed to differences in  muscle typology. However, {ST} individuals performed a significantly higher  training volume to gain these similar adaptations as {FT} individuals. The limb  that trained 3x/week had generally more pronounced hypertrophy than the limb that  trained 2x/week, and there was no interaction with muscle typology. In  conclusion, muscle typology cannot explain the high variability in resistance  training adaptations when training is performed to failure at 60\% of 1RM. {KEY}  {POINTS}: This study investigated the influence of muscle typology ( = muscle fiber  type composition) on the variability in resistance training adaptations and on  its role in the individualization of resistance training frequency. We  demonstrate that an individual's muscle typology cannot explain the  inter-individual variability in resistance training induced increases in muscle  volume, maximal dynamic strength and fiber cross-sectional area when repetitions  are performed to failure. Importantly, slow typology individuals performed a  significantly higher training volume to obtain similar adaptations compared to  fast typology individuals. Muscle typology does not determine the most  appropriate resistance training frequency. However, regardless of muscle  typology, an additional weekly training (3x/week vs 2x/week) increases muscle  hypertrophy but not maximal dynamic strength. These findings expand on our  understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the large inter-individual  variability in resistance training adaptations. Abstract figure legend This study  investigated if muscle typology can explain the high variability in resistance  training adaptations. Slow and fast typology resistance training novices were  selected to participate in this study by the non-invasive measurement of muscle  carnosine with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After the chronic training  period a high inter-individual variability was observed in changes in muscle  volume, maximal dynamic strength and fiber cross-sectional area. However, this  high inter-individual variability could not be explained by muscle typology for  any of the outcomes. Visual abstract created with {BioRender}. This article is  protected by copyright.

Our analyses revealed moderate effects of resistance training on muscle strength  and vertical jump performance ({SMDwm} 0.8-1.09), and small effects on linear  sprint, agility and sport-specific performance ({SMDwm} 0.58-0.75). Effects were  moderated by sex and resistance training type. Independently computed  dose-response relationships for resistance training parameters revealed that a  training period of {\textgreater}23 weeks, 5 sets/exercise, 6-8 repetitions/set, a training  intensity of 80-89\% of 1 repetition maximum ({RM}), and 3-4 min rest between sets  were most effective to improve muscle strength ({SMDwm} 2.09-3.40).  {SUMMARY}/{CONCLUSIONS}: Resistance training is an effective method to enhance muscle  strength and jump performance in youth athletes, moderated by sex and resistance  training type. Dose-response relationships for key training parameters indicate  that youth coaches should primarily implement resistance training programmes with  fewer repetitions and higher intensities to improve physical performance measures  of youth athletes.},

All training groups  attended supervised resistance training twice a week for 3 months. For the  following 6 months, they continued training with different frequencies (1, 2 or 3  times per week). Psychological functioning was measured by quality of life  ({WHOQOL}-Bref), sense of coherence (Antonovsky's {SOC}-13), and depressive symptoms  (Beck's Depression Inventory {II}). Measurements were conducted at baseline and 3  and 9 months after baseline. The effects of the intervention were analyzed using  generalized estimating equations ({GEE}). {RESULTS}: After 3 months, there was an  intervention effect on environmental quality of life (group × time p = .048).  Between 3 and 9 months, environmental quality of life decreased among {RT}1  compared to {RT}2 and {RT}3 (group × time p = .025).

	abstract = {Abstract Aim To describe ribosome biogenesis during resistance training, its relation to training volume and muscle growth. Methods A training group (n = 11) performed 12 sessions (3-4 sessions per week) of unilateral knee extension with constant and variable volume (6 and 3-9 sets per session respectively) allocated to either leg. Ribosome abundance and biogenesis markers were assessed from vastus lateralis biopsies obtained at baseline, 48 hours after sessions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 12, and after eight days of de-training, and from a control group (n = 8). Muscle thickness was measured before and after the intervention. Results Training led to muscle growth (3.9\% over baseline values, 95\% {CrI}: [0.2, 7.5] vs. control) with concomitant increases in total {RNA}, ribosomal {RNA}, upstream binding factor ({UBF}) and ribosomal protein S6 with no differences between volume conditions. Total {RNA} increased rapidly in response to the first four sessions (8.6\% [5.6, 11.7] per session), followed by a plateau and peak values after session 8 (49.5\% [34.5, 66.5] above baseline). Total {RNA} abundance was associated with {UBF} protein levels (5.0\% [0.2, 10.2] per unit {UBF}), and the rate of increase in total {RNA} levels predicted hypertrophy (0.3 mm [0.1, 0.4] per \%-point increase in total {RNA} per session). After de-training, total {RNA} decreased (−19.3\% [−29.0, −8.1]) without muscle mass changes indicating halted biosynthesis of ribosomes. Conclusion Ribosomes accumulate in the initial phase of resistance training with abundances sensitive to training cessation and associated with {UBF} protein levels. The average accumulation rate predicts muscle training-induced hypertrophy.},

However, the roles of specific {lncRNAs} in {ceRNA} network of lung adenocarcinoma ({LUAD}) remains largely unclear. Herein, we identified the roles of {lncRNA} {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1/{AS}2 ({ADAMTS}-{AS}1/{AS}2) in lung adenocarcinoma by bioinformatics analyses and functional verification. First, differentially expressed genes {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1, {ADAMTS}9-{AS}2 and {ADAMTS}9 were screened out from {GSE}130779. Then the expression correlation of these three genes was analyzed. The results showed that {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1, {ADAMTS}9-{AS}2 and {ADAMTS}9 were down-regulated in {LUAD}, and were positively correlated with each other. After that, {miRcode} was used to find {miR}-150 which binds to {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1/{ADAMTS}9-{AS}2/{ADAMTS}9. Next, co-expression analysis and functional enrichment analyses were performed to further analyze differentially expressed genes. The results showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Beta3 integrin cell surface interactions and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally, the cell functions of {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1 and {ADAMTS}9-{AS}2 in A549 and {NCI}-H1299 cell lines were verified.

However, the roles of {lncRNA}-associated {ceRNAs} in oncogenesis are not fully understood. The present study aims to determine whether a {ceRNA} network can serve as a prognostic marker in human prostate cancer ({PCa}). In order to identify a {ceRNA} network and the key {lncRNAs} in {PCa}, we constructed a differentially expressed {lncRNAs} ({DELs})–differentially expressed {miRNAs} ({DEMis})–differentially expressed {mRNAs} ({DEMs}) regulatory network based on the {ceRNA} theory using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}). We found that the {DELs}–{DEMis}–{DEMs} network was composed of 27 {DELs} nodes, seven {DEMis} nodes, and three {DEMs} nodes. The 27 {DELs} were further analyzed with several public databases to provide meaningful information for understanding the functional roles of {lncRNAs} in regulatory networks in {PCa}. We selected {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1 to determine its role in {PCa} and found that {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1 significantly influences tumor cell growth and proliferation, suggesting that it plays a tumor suppressive role. In addition, {ADAMTS}9-{AS}1 functioned as {ceRNA}, effectively becoming a sponge for hsa-mir-96 and modulating the expression of {PRDM}16. These results suggest that {ceRNAs} could accelerate biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies for {PCa}.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle is composed of multinucleated myofibers that arise from the fusion of myoblasts during development. Skeletal muscle is essential for various body functions such as maintaining posture, locomotion, breathing, and metabolism. Skeletal muscle undergoes remarkable adaptations in response to environmental stimuli leading to atrophy or hypertrophy. Moreover, degeneration of skeletal muscle is a common feature in a number of muscular disorders including muscular dystrophy. Emerging evidence suggests that noncoding {RNAs}, such as {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) and long noncoding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}), are critical for skeletal muscle physiology. Several {miRNAs} and {lncRNAs} have now been found to control skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Noncoding {RNAs} also play an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass in adults. Furthermore, aberrant expression of {miRNAs} and {lncRNAs} has been observed in several muscular disorders. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of action of {miRNAs} and {lncRNAs} in skeletal muscle formation, growth, regeneration, and disease. We further highlight potential therapeutic strategies for utilizing noncoding {RNAs} to improve skeletal muscle function.},

Such competing  endogenous {RNAs} ({ceRNAs}) regulate the distribution of {miRNA} molecules on their  targets and thereby impose an additional level of post-transcriptional  regulation. Here we identify a muscle-specific long noncoding {RNA}, linc-{MD}1,  which governs the time of muscle differentiation by acting as a {ceRNA} in mouse  and human myoblasts. Downregulation or overexpression of linc-{MD}1 correlate with  retardation or anticipation of the muscle differentiation program, respectively.  We show that linc-{MD}1 "sponges" {miR}-133 and {miR}-133 [corrected] to regulate the  expression of {MAML}1 and {MEF}2C, transcription factors that activate  muscle-specific gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that linc-{MD}1 exerts the  same control over differentiation timing in human myoblasts, and that its levels  are strongly reduced in Duchenne muscle cells. We conclude that the {ceRNA} network  plays an important role in muscle differentiation.},

	abstract = {Intron retention ({IR}) is a form of alternative splicing that has long been neglected in mammalian systems although it has been studied for decades in non-mammalian species such as plants, fungi, insects and viruses. It was generally assumed that mis-splicing, leading to the retention of introns, would have no physiological consequence other than reducing gene expression by nonsense-mediated decay. Relatively recent landmark discoveries have highlighted the pivotal role that {IR} serves in normal and disease-related human biology. Significant technical hurdles have been overcome, thereby enabling the robust detection and quantification of {IR}. Still, relatively little is known about the cis- and trans-acting modulators controlling this phenomenon. The fate of an intron to be, or not to be, retained in the mature transcript is the direct result of the influence exerted by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors at multiple levels of regulation. These factors have altered current biological paradigms and provided unexpected insights into the transcriptional landscape. In this review, we discuss the regulators of {IR} and methods to identify them. Our focus is primarily on mammals, however, we broaden the scope to non-mammalian organisms in which {IR} has been shown to be biologically relevant.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing ({AS}) of precursor {RNAs} is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes. Of the different  classes of {AS}, intron retention ({IR}) is the least well understood. In plants and  unicellular eukaryotes, {IR} is the most common form of {AS}, whereas in animals, it  is thought to represent the least prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A)(+)  {RNA}-seq data, we observe that {IR} is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting  transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly  correlated set of cis features comprising an "{IR} code" reliably discriminates  retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that {IR} acts widely to  reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology  of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected. This "transcriptome  tuning" function of {IR} acts through both nonsense-mediated {mRNA} decay and nuclear  sequestration and turnover of {IR} transcripts. We further show that {IR} is linked  to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of {RNA} polymerase {II} (Pol  {II}) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the  results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment  of splicing components coupled to Pol {II} pausing underlies widespread {IR}-mediated  suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts.},

Nine “Aging Hallmarks”, proposed by López-Otín, offer insights into the aging process; however, the link between these hallmarks and exercise is not fully elucidated. In this study, we conducted a systematic multi-omics analysis of skeletal muscles, focusing on aging and exercise, based on gene signatures for aging hallmarks. It is posited that {mRNA} splicing activity, linked to genomic instability, constitutes a fundamental hallmark of aging, and it exhibits divergent expression patterns in response to aging and exercise. Additionally, we analysed splicing events and discovered that intron retention ({IR}) is significantly impacted by aging, exhibiting contrasting changes to those induced by resistance training in the older cohort. The isoforms characterised by {IR} are notably enriched in mitochondrial functions. Conclusively, our results underscore the significance of splicing mechanisms as a novel aspect of aging hallmarks in skeletal muscles and propose a new mechanism by which exercise exerts its anti-aging effects on skeletal muscles through intron retention.Key points {summarySkeletal} muscle aging involves significant structural and functional changes, including loss of muscle mass, decline in strength, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all influenced by genomic instability.Exercise has been identified as a key intervention that counters genomic instability and modulates {mRNA} splicing patterns, particularly through the regulation of Intron Retention, to mitigate aging effects in skeletal muscle.We reveal the novel role of {IR}, especially in principal isoforms, where it is linked to critical cellular processes like mitochondrial function, suggesting a targeted pathway through which exercise exerts its anti-aging effects.The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on aging skeletal muscle.This study lays the groundwork for future research on exercise-induced modulation of {mRNA} splicing as a therapeutic strategy for aging and potentially age-related diseases, pointing towards a significant shift in how we approach aging intervention strategies.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

Aging research has  experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the  discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by  genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review  enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging  in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks  are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of  proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular  senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A  major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate  hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of  identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with  minimal side effects.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: sarcopenia plays a principal role in the pathogenesis of frailty and functional impairment that occur with aging. There are few published accounts  that examine the overall benefit of resistance exercise ({RE}) for lean body mass  ({LBM}) while considering a continuum of dosage schemes and/or age ranges.  Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the effects of {RE}  on {LBM} in older men and women while taking these factors into consideration.  {METHODS}: this study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews  and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Randomized controlled trials and randomized or  nonrandomized studies among adults ≥ 50 yr were included. Heterogeneity between  studies was assessed using the Cochran Q and the I statistics, and publication  bias was evaluated through physical inspection of funnel plots as well as formal  rank-correlation statistics. Mixed-effects meta-regression was incorporated to  assess the relationship between {RE} dosage and changes in {LBM}. {RESULTS}: data from  49 studies, representing a total of 1328 participants, were pooled using  random-effect models. Results demonstrated a positive effect for {LBM}, and there  was no evidence of publication bias. The Cochran Q statistic for heterogeneity  was 497.8, which was significant (P {\textless} 0.01). Likewise, I was equal to 84\%,  representing rejection of the null hypothesis of homogeneity. The weighted pooled  estimate of mean {LBM} change was 1.1 kg (95\% confidence interval = 0.9-1.2 kg).  Meta-regression revealed that higher-volume interventions were associated (β =  0.05, P {\textless} 0.01) with significantly greater increases in {LBM}, whereas older  individuals experienced less increase (β = -0.03, P = 0.01). {CONCLUSIONS}: {RE} is  effective for eliciting gains in {LBM} among aging adults, particularly with  higher-volume programs. Findings suggest that {RE} participation earlier in life  may provide superior effectiveness.},

The  relative amount of myosin heavy chain ({MHC}) I (P{\textless}0.05) decreased and the relative  amount of {MHC} {IIA} increased (P{\textless}0.05). No effects in the overall number of  capillaries per area was observed, but an increase in the number of capillary  contacts in the type 2 fiber pool was observed. Heavy resistance training does  have beneficial effects on muscle strength and muscle volume in very old frail  humans. Furthermore, an increase in fiber size of the fast muscle fibers and an  overall increase in the relative amount of fast {MHC} {IIA} can lead not only to a  stronger, but maybe more importantly, to a more powerful skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing is a co-transcriptional process, which allows for the production of multiple transcripts from a single gene and is emerging as an important control point for gene expression. Alternatively expressed isoforms often have antagonistic function and differential temporal or spatial expression patterns, yielding enormous plasticity and adaptability to cells and increasing their ability to respond to environmental challenge. The regulation of alternative splicing is critical for numerous cellular functions in both pathological and physiological conditions, and deregulated alternative splicing is a key feature of common chronic diseases. Isoform choice is controlled by a battery of splicing regulatory proteins, which include the serine arginine rich ({SRSF}) proteins and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein ({hnRNP}) classes of genes. These important splicing regulators have been implicated in age-related disease, and in the ageing process itself. This review will outline the important contribution of splicing regulator proteins to ageing and age-related disease.},

	abstract = {Background:. Master athletes ({MAs}) prove that preserving a high level of physical function up to very late in life is possible, but the mechanisms responsible for their high function remain unclear. Methods:. We performed muscle biopsies in 15 octogenarian world-class track and field {MAs} and 14 non-athlete age/sex-matched controls ({NA}) to provide insights into mechanisms for preserving function in advanced age. Muscle samples were assessed for respiratory compromised fibers, mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) copy number, and proteomics by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Results:. {MA} exhibited markedly better performance on clinical function tests and greater cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle. Proteomics analysis revealed marked differences, where most of the {\textasciitilde}800 differentially represented proteins in {MA} versus {NA} pertained to mitochondria structure/function such as electron transport capacity ({ETC}), cristae formation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and {mtDNA}-encoded proteins. In contrast, proteins from the spliceosome complex and nuclear pore were downregulated in {MA}. Consistent with proteomics data, {MA} had fewer respiratory compromised fibers, higher {mtDNA} copy number, and an increased protein ratio of the cristae-bound {ETC} subunits relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel. There was a substantial overlap of proteins overrepresented in {MA} versus {NA} with proteins that decline with aging and that are higher in physically active than sedentary individuals. However, we also found 176 proteins related to mitochondria that are uniquely differentially expressed in {MA}. Conclusions:. We conclude that high function in advanced age is associated with preserving mitochondrial structure/function proteins, with underrepresentation of proteins involved in the spliceosome and nuclear pore complex. Whereas many of these differences in {MA} appear related to their physical activity habits, others may reflect unique biological (e.g., gene, environment) mechanisms that preserve muscle integrity and function with aging.

Per sample, across a variety of  transcriptome sequencing datasets, two-pass alignment improved quantification of  at least 94\% of simulated novel splice junctions, and provided as much as  1.7-fold deeper median read depth over those splice junctions. We further  demonstrate that two-pass alignment works by increasing alignment of reads to  splice junctions by short lengths, and that potential alignment errors are  readily identifiable by simple classification. Taken together, two-pass alignment  promises to advance quantification and discovery of novel splicing events.  {CONTACT}: arul@med.umich.edu, nesvi@med.umich.edu {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}:  Two-pass alignment was implemented here as sequential alignment, genome indexing,  and re-alignment steps with {STAR}.
