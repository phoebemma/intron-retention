## Introduction

This study is aimed at investigating splicing efficiency (SE) differences between the young and old, and the potential impact of progressive resistance exercise could have on SE. It uses SpliceQ @demelocosta2021 to quantify splicing efficiency in four datasets;

the \[COPD dataset\] (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261934/>),

\[Volume dataset\] (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708234/>),

Contratrain dataset

and

\[SRP102542\] (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28273480/>),

## Repository Organisation

`/R`

This contains the scripts with codes used for data analyses.

1.  \`/Data_extraction\` A folder containing five different R scripts that show how the five different datasets were processed
2.  \`SpliceQ_from_scratch.R\` details the steps in processing the SpliceQ data generated from RNA Seq data
3.  \`metadata_extraction.R\` shows how metadata from the Trainome files are generated and processed
4.  \`metadata_public_data.R\` shows how the metadata from the publicly available RNA-Seq data were generated\
