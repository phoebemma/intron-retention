## Introduction

This study is aimed at investigating splicing efficiency (SE) differences between the young and old, and the potential impact progressive resistance exercise could have on SE. It uses SpliceQ @demelocosta2021 to quantify splicing efficiency in five datasets; the \[COPD dataset\] (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261934/>), \[Volume dataset\] (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708234/>), \[SRP102542\] (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28273480/>), \[SRP043368\] (<https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1096/fj.14-255000>) and \[SRP280348\] (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33071237/>)

## Repository Organisation

`/R`

This contains the scripts with codes used for data analyses.

1.  \`/Data_extraction\` A folder containing five different R scripts that show how the five different datasets were processed
2.  \`SpliceQ_from_scratch.R\` details the steps in processing the SpliceQ data generated from RNA Seq data
3.  \`metadata_extraction.R\` shows how metadata from the Trainome files are generated and processed
4.  \`metadata_public_data.R\` shows how the metadata from the publicly available RNA-Seq data were generated\
